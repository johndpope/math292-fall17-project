    "# Vector representations of words\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods one might use to build a semantic network with words as nodes and similarity scores as weights on edges. We could also threshold this weight and just keep unweighted edges that were greater than the threshold. A Bayesian approach like Latent Dirichlet Allocation would build a semantic network with weights being probabilities of relatedness. In this vector space model (VSM) of semantics, similarity is given by the cosine of the angle between two vector representations of words, $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",

    "In this notebook, I'll use TensorFlow to build and query a semantic network by following this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/word2vec/\n",

    "In particular, I'm taking all the code from the file `word2vec_basic` that was being run as a script and putting it here, or I have rolled it in to other helper functions that I import. I tried to put the most relevant lines here so it was clear what the essential elements are. In the script `word2vec_basic.py`, I have put all these into a function called `run_word2vec()`."
