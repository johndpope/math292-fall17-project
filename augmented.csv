2 million households in new jersey are still without electricity today day three for reference in terms of how much of the country that means even if there were only one person in each of the new jersey households without power which is t isn t true even if it was just one the number of households without power in new jersey means there are more people in day three than the population of each of these states that is marked on the map this is a huge number of americans we are talking about here and this is not over this is not something that is done it is not past tense widespread flooding is still present and the national guard today bringing food and supplies to hoboken new jersey he talked about hoboken on last night s show the dire situation there hoboken is a little town directly across the hudson river from manhattan it is small but it's got 50 000 people in it you can see hoboken clearly from the west side of new york city and as of last night the mayor told us there were as many as 20 000 people of the population 50 000 people in the city there were as many as 20 000 people still stranded in deep impassable and increasingly polluted floodwaters the national guard did get to some of those people starting late last night and into today we ll have more about that very dramatic situation in just a moment the national guard also arrived this morning in moonachie new jersey where the storm surge swamped the town very very quickly people in all sorts of housing in moonachie were caught unaware and trapped but particularly folks in mobile homes had a very difficult time

human chain to cover fuel to the backup generator up on the roof 13 floors up well today the national guard used helicopters to fly fuel to the roof of the building they also had individual soldiers today lugging fuel one canister at a time up those 13 flights of stairs it turned out even with those heroic and exhausting efforts the damage was much worse than expected at bellevue and by lunchtime today critical care patients including kids were being evacuated one by one to other hospitals that effort that evacuation at this hour is still ongoing today also afforded a clear and harrowing look at the aftermath of monday night s inferno in the new york city community of breezy point queens that fire burned down 111 homes 111 houses as floodwaters kept firefighters out a lot of firefighters live in breezy point it is a community that lost a lot of first responders on 9 11 and now this a series of natural gas fires also broke out early this morning in the new jersey shore town of

hit,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121116_030000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that s a very good question it's certainly something the israelis are leaving on the table at this point there s a lot of speculation one of the things the israelis are not able to say is what would actually trigger a ground offensive there are some who are saying for instance if tel aviv took a direct hit from a larger rocket that could trigger a ground offensive we asked spokespeople for the israeli defense forces and they're just not willing to commit and say this would be where the red line would be crossed however they are continuously saying that yes they are perfectly capable and willing to start a ground offense if they feel they are not achieving their objectives with the aerial bombardment or if they feel they need to do more than they are doing right now they say what they are doing right now is called surgical air strikes where they say they are predominantly taking out these rocket positions in gaza they say if they feel they are not achieving that objective then a ground offensive would still very much be in the cards the other thing they're doing is they are also mobilizing the reserves which is another indication that they are very very seriously serious about possibly going into gaza with ground troops,0

didn t want that to change as he became president i loved barak just the way he was you see even back then when barak was a senator and a presidential candidate to me he was still the guy who picked me up for our dates in a car that was so rusted out i could actually see the pavement going by in a hole in the passenger s side door he was the guy whose proudest possession was a coffee table he had found in a dumpster and whose only pair of decent shoes was a half size too small but see when barak started telling me about his family see now that is when i knew i had found a kindred spirit somebody whose values and upbringing were so much like mine you see barak and i were both raised by families who didn t have much in the way of material possessions but who had given us something far more valuable their unconditional love their unflinching sacrifice and the chance to go places they had never imagined for themselves my father was a pump operator at the city water plant and he was decided with ms when my brother and i were young and even as a kid i knew there were plenty of days when he was in pain and i knew there were plenty of mornings when it was a struggle for him to simply get out of bed but every morning i watched my father wake up with a smile now grab his walker prop his walker slowly shave and button his uniform and when he returned home after a long day s work my brother and i would stand at the top of the stairs in our little apartment patiently waiting to greet him watching as he bent down to lift one leg and the oer to slowly climb his way into our arms but despite these challenges my dad hardly ever missed a day of work he and my mom were determined to give me and my brother the kind of education they could only dream of as i got to know barak i realized that even though he had grown up all the way across the country he had been brought up just like me barak was raised by a single mom who struggled to pay the bills and by grandparents who stepped in when she needed help barak s grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank and she moved quickly up the ranks but like so many women she hit a glass ceiling and for years men no more qualified than she was men she had actually trained were promoted up the ladder ahead of her earning more and more money while barak s family continued to scrape by but day after day she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus arriving at work before anyone else giving her best without complaint or regret and she would often tell barak so long as you kids do well bear that is all that really matters like so many american families our families were not asking for much they didn t begrudge anyone else s success okay that anyone else or they didn t care that anybody else had much more they simply believed in the fundamental american promise that even if you don t start out with much if you work hard and do what you re supposed to do you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids that is how they raised us those are the values that barak and i and so many of you are trying to pass on to our own children that is who we are and standing before you four years ago i knew that i didn t want any of that to change if barak became president well today after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways i never would have imagined i have seen firsthand that being president doesn t change who you are no it reveals who you are are you see i have gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like and i have seen how the issues that come across a president s desk are always the hard ones you know the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer the judgment calls where thestakes are so high and there is no margin for error and as president you will get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people but at the end of the day when it comes time to make that decision as president all you have to guide you are your values and vision and the life experiences that make you who you are so when it comes to re building our economy barak is thinking about folks like my dad and his grandmother he is thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day s work that is why he signed the lilly ledbetter pay act to help women get fair work that is why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet that is how he brought our economy from the edge of collapse to creating jobs again jobs you can raise a family on good jobs right here in the united states of america when it comes to the health of our families barak refused to listen to all of those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day another president he didn t care whether it was theasy thing to do politically no that is not how he was raised he cared that it was the right thing to do he did it because he believes that here in america our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine our kids should be able to see a doctor when they're sick and nobody in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or an illness and he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care that is what my husband stands for when it comes to giving our kids the education they deserve barak knows that like me and like so many of you he never could have attended college without financial aid and believe it or not when we were first married our combined monthly student loan bill was actually higher than our mortgage yeah we were so young so in love and so in debt and that is why barak has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt,1

more than 4 million americans had already lost their jobs and america s bravest our men and women in uniform were fighting for what soon would be the longest war in our history you remember the uncertainty and the fear that seized our country on that first day i said mr president which crisis do you want to tackle first he looked me in the eye with that look he usually reserved just for his chief of staff rahm we were sent here to tackle all of them not choose between them there was no blueprint or how to manual for fixing a global financial meltdown an auto crisis and two wars and a recession all at the same time believe me if it existed i would have found it each crisis was so deep and so dangerous any one of them would have defined another presidency we faced a once in a generation moment in american history and fortunately for all of us we have a once in a generation president and in those uncharted waters i saw when the president finds his north star every night president obama reads ten letters from everyday americans when i met with the president at the end of each day he made sure he had their letters to read at his residence letters from people just hoping for someone in power to understand their struggles i can't tell you how many times whether we were discussing the economy health care or energy crisis the president walked to his desk take out one of the letters and read them to us andsay this is who we are fighting for parents working hard to save for their ild s education middle class americans fighting tooth and nail to hold on to their jobs their homes or their life savings it is their voices that president obama brings to the oval office it is their values i saw him fight for every day in the first month in office he fought for the american recovery act to cut taxes for the middle class to put people to work building america s roads rails and runways and today our economy has gone from losing 800 000 jobs a month to adding four and a half million private sector jobs in the last 29 months thinki bankings banks are lending again in case we forget that was a change we believed in a change we fought for that was the change president obama delivered president obama took office knowing full well that for the last century presidents had tried to reform our health care system today because of president obama s courage kids can stay on their parents s plan until they're 26 insurers can't kick you off your policy because you have a pre because you have hit the pre existing limit they wouldn t be able to deny you because you have a pre existing condition because of president obama s leadership every american will have access to affordable quality health care that was the change we believed in that was the change we fought for that was the change president obama delivered i saw the president make the tough calls in the situation ro room and today our troops in iraq have finally come home so america can do some nation building here at home that was a change we believed in and a change we fought for that was a change president obama delivered i remember when the president received the report that the auto industry had a few weeks before its collapse we met in the roosevelt room late into the night some of the president s advisers said that in order to save general motors you had to let chrysler go under others said it is like throwing good money after bad among all the experts there were only guesses and nobody put it at better than a one in four shot only the president suggested going all in to save the industry and the jobs now the one thing i know with absolute certainty having served two great presidents is that in the next four years an unforeseen crisis challenge or conflict is going to show up and seize this country whose leadership whose judgment whose values do you want in the white house when that crisis lands like a thud on the oval office desk that is right the person who said in four years let detroitgo bankrupt or a president who had another four words not on my watch a person who believes in giving tax cuts to the most fortunate or a president who believes in making college affordable for all americans a person who wanted to keep don t ask don t tell or a president who believes that keeping you from loving the person you love should not happen when the fall of uncertainty surrounds a crisis storms into the white house and all the advisers chiefs of staffs only have guesses to help the president it will be the president s leadership that determines how we as a nation face the challenges that meet the middle class it is the president s values that shape the future in which the middle class has hope the person who takes the oval office in the next four months will shape not only the next four years but the next 40 years in this great nation in this next four years we need proven leadership and proven judgment and values america needs four more years

you did last night michelle on monday night but i know him to state the obvious from a differentperspective i know him and i want to show you i want to show you the character of a leader who had what it took when the american people literally stood on the brink of a new depression a leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years to a future as great as our people i want to take you inside the white house to see the president as i see him every day because i don t see him in sound bites i walk 30 paces down the hall into the oval office and i see him i watch him in action four years ago the middle class was already losing ground and then the bottom fell out the financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people i grew up with you remember the headlines you saw some of them in thepreviews highlight highest job losses in 60 years headlines economy on the brink markets plummet worldwide from the very moment president obama sat behind the desk resolute in the oval office he knew he knew he had not only to restore the confidence of a nation but he had to restore the confidence of the wholeworld and he also knew he also knew that one one false move could bring a run on the banks or a credit collapse to put another several million people out of work america and the world needed a strong president with a steady hand and with the judgment and vision to see us through day after day night after night i sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after the other to stop the slide and reverse it i watched him i watched him stand up i watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous enormo challenges the consequences of which were awesome but most of all i got to see firsthand what drove this man his profound concern for the average american he knew he knew that no matter how tough this decisions he had to make were in that oval office he knew that families all over america sitting at their kitchen tables were literally making decisions for their family that were equally as consequential you know barack and i we ve been through a lot together these four years and we learned about one another a lot about one another and one of the things i learned about barack is the enormity of his heart and i think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him applause and there s another thing another thing that has bound us together these past four years we had a pretty good idea what all those families all you americans in trouble were goingthrough in part because our own families had gone through similarstruggles barack as a young man had to sit at the end of his mother s hospital bed and watch her fight with her insurance company at the very same time she was fighting for her life when i was a young kid in third grade i remember my dad coming up the stairs in my grand pop s house where we were living sitting at the end of my bed and saying joey im going to have to leave for a while go down to wilmington delaware with uncle frank there are good jobs down there honey in a little while a little while i ll be able to send for you and mom and jimmy and val and everything s going to be fine for the rest of our life my sister and my brothers for the rest of our life my dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it's about applause it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in thecommunity it's about being able to look your child in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay and mean it and know it's true when barack and i were growing up there was an implicit understanding in america that if you took responsibility you d get a fair shot at abetter life and the values the values behind that bargain were the values that has shaped both us and many many of you and today those same values are barack s guiding star folks i ve watched him he has never wavered he never never backs down he always steps up and he alwaysasks in either one of thos critical meetings the same fundamental question how is this going to affect the average american how is this going to affect people s lives that s what s inside this man that s what makes him tick that s who he is applause folks because of the decisions he has made and the incredible strength of the american people america has turned the corner the worst job loss since the great depression we ve since created 4 5 million private sector jobs in the last 29 months as i mentioned at the outset four years ago we were hit hard you saw you saw your retirement accounts drained the equity in your homes vanished jobs lost along the line what did you do as americans what you ve always done you didn t lose faith you fought back you didn t give up you got up the american people you re the ones you re the reason why we are still better positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st century you never quit on america and you deserve a president who will never quit on you applause my fellow americans we now find ourselves at the hinge of history in the direction we turn is not figuratively it's literally inyour hands it has been a truly great honor to serve you and to serve with barack who has always stood up with you for the past four years i ve seen him tested i know his strength his commands his faith and i also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you i know this man yes the work of recovery is not yet complete but we are on our way the journey of hope is not yet finished but we are on our way and the cause of change is not fully accomplished but we are on our way so i say to you tonight with absolute confidence america s best days are ahead and yes we are on our way and in light of that horizon for the values that define us for the ideals that inspire us there is only one choice that choice is to move forward boldly forward and finish the job and re elect president barack obama god bless you all and may godprotect our troops god bless

have a secretary of state john bolton we are not bringing dick cheney back we are not going to have a foreign policy shop stocked with architects of the iraq war we are not going to do it we had the chance to do that if we wanted to do that as a country and we said no last night loudly now to be fair if you are a conservative or if you are rooting for the republicans a few things did go your way republicans did not lose that senate seat that they might have lost in arizona jon kyl s old senate seat goes to another republican to jeff flake also republicans did not lose that other senate seat they might have lost in nevada the old jon ensign seat that was given to dean heller it stays with him and while president obama carried 28 states last time he carried 26 or 27 states this time depending on how florida goes that means republicans did lose everything else but got back indiana and also north carolina so it was not a totally hopeless night for republicans also hey remember the crazy thaddeus mccotter seat in michigan where thaddeus mccotter screwed up and they had to run this reindeer herder santa claus impersonator for the seat a guy whose own brother says he s crazy that guy won the shirtless reindeer guy won so the republicans have him big picture in the house thanks mostly to redistricting the republicans were not in danger of losing the house and they didn t legal cause it even though the republican majority appears to have shrunk there and even though they did get the reindeer guy but in terms of honestly of what went well for republicans in this election that was pretty much it it is a short list want to talk about what went well on the other side last night im actually going to pause for a second to give you a chance to hit pause on your dvr in case you want to go make popcorn or something maybe mix a drink you ll want to settle in for this so get comfortable i ll give you a second celebrate good times come on you back we ready so last night the democratic senator who was supposed to be the most endangered incumbent in the country not only won she won by 16 points republican senator scott brown of massachusetts who was so stuffed with hedge fund misunderstood that he burped credit default swaps scott brown lost by a lot to the nation s foremost authority on the economic rights of the middle class after marriage rights for same sex couples were voted down in state after state after state for years more than 30 times in a row this year all change in maine they voted on marriage equality and they voted for it in maryland they voted on marriage equality and they voted for it in minnesota they were asked to vote against marriage equality and minnesota refused to ban it in washington state the vote is not called yet they are still counting the vote and we will be watching it closely but if you are on the pro gay right side in washington state it should be noted that it is looking pretty good in iowa anti gay activists were sure that they were going to turf out a judge for ruling in favor of marriage equality they had done it before to a bunch of other judges they had been successful every time they had tried before but not this one not this time judge wiggins in iowa keeps his seat nevada elects its first african american congressman this year america gets our first openly gay united states senator america gets our first ever asian american woman senator from hawaii her seat in the house i should note gets filled by this woman a democratic iraq war veteran time going to tell you right now that her name is tulsy gabboard because she is on the fast track to being very famous some day speaking of iraq war veterans tammy duckworth veteran helicopter pilot lost both her legs in iraq she is going to congress and sending home the opponent who mocked her for her war record joe walsh california relaxed its three strikes you re out law and rejected a law to cripple the power of unions criminal legalization of marijuana was approved in washington and montana sherrod brown and jon tester both won held on to their seats democrats won a senate seat in north dakota of all places a seat that nobody thought they could win all of these states that had this hugely aggressive total republican takeover from the 2010 elections ohio and wisconsin and michigan and pennsylvania and virginia and florida all of those states that went so red in state government in these past couple of years and that then had these big fights inside their states over how republicans were governing there in ohio wisconsin michigan pennsylvania virginia and we will see about florida last night not only did republicans lose the presidential election in every single one of those states republicans lost the senate race in every single one of those states too sherrod brown tammy baldwin debbie stabenow bob casey tim kaine bill nelson depending on florida a democratic sweep of the presidency and definitely a democratic sweep of the senate races in those states that the gop was so excited to have supposedly turned red in a way that was going to stick last night democratic women swept every major office in new hampshire last night california democrats wanted democratic super majority in the state house and in the state senate not just majorities in california but super majorities wherein if the republicans don t turn up any of them any day at work nothing will be different in california they're completely legislatively irrelevant alan west lost a seat more women got elected to the U.S. senate than at any time in U.S. history the republican presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee both lost their home states missouri and montana and west virginia chose democratic governors west virginia chose its first gay state legislature so did north dakota west virginia and north dakota yeah seriously joe lieberman s old seat went to a real democrat in connecticut the proportion of young people voting compared to 2008 it went up same with african americans up from 2008 same with latinos up from 2008 not down up if you are a liberal or if you are rooting for the democrats last night was a very very very big night and oh yeah this happened president barack obama yes will go down in history as our nation s first african american president but he will also go down in history as the most successful democratic presidential candidate since fdr president clinton got re elected too i know but only barack obama got re elected with not just big electoral college margins but also with majority wins in the popular vote twice the guy who predicted this outcome almost exactly is nate silver of course who writes the political statistics blog 538 at the new york times for accurately predicting it appears the exact outcome of the race and i mean down to every single state we ll see about florida nate was of course pilloried pilloried on the right and by right leaning beltway media types including politico com for having the audacity to print what his poll averages told him was about to happen but nate was right the polls were right even without florida being decided we now know that president obama won in pretty much exactly the way the state by state polls said he was going to win he won with more than 300 electoral votes it was not magic it was just math math that was completely invisible to the political right,0

evening s talking points memo over the thanksgiving weekend i was down in austin in houston texas doing shows with miller it's been a while since i had visited the lone star state and i took a good look around next week i will be going tout to california the state with the largest population texas is second fascinating to compare the two places because they signify the clash the clash that s taking place in america right now texas voted for romney by about 1 3 million votes california voted for obama by about 2 3 million votes texas conservative state california dominated by liberal americans both states have more minority voters than white voters the overriding tradition of texas is that self reliance rules most voters there don t want government telling them what to do therefore they don t have a lot of social service no state income tax in texas however get in the lone star state about 40 billion there is a balanced budget amendment by contrast california owes an astounding 167 billion and it's running an annual deficit of about 9 billion money they that can never never be paid back what is california getting for all of that high school graduation rate 37 out of 50 states per capita income 44 500 but there is a 10 1 unemployment rate crime number one there are more prisoners in california than any other state take a look at texas high school graduation rate ranks 44th slightly above california per capita income about 40 000 bucks per year but there is relatively low unemployment 6 6 convicts in state prisoners ranked number two behind california so you can see there is not a big difference in the economic and social stats but there is a big difference in mind set california has many more social welfare programs golden state also has many more business regulations texas you could pretty much set up any bigness you want you can also ride a motorcycle without a helmet talk on the cell phone without a car and on and on texans basically saying hey government get out of our lives californians on the other hand generally embrace big government in just about all areas i mean when the city council of san francisco proposes to ban gold fish you know you have intrusive situation same city council finally banned publicity nudity last week except for permitted festivals or parades thank god the thanksgiving day parade not held in the city by the bay in texas if you run around naked and make a wrong move you might get shot the state allows its citizens to carry concealed weapons can't do that if you are naked in california only vicious drug cartel people carry guns because if the regular folks do likely be big trouble get in big trouble when the cartel guys go back to mexico can you see there is a stark difference between living in texas and living in california the question for all americans is what place do you think is better i like both states they are fascinating i don t want to live in a nanny state that s what california is new york is getting there as well where i live california is also going bankrupt 167 billion in debt are you kidding me that is grossly irresponsible for a state with as many natural resources as california i mean these pinheads in sacramento think they can just spend money and other people have to pick up the tab meantime in texas if you hit it big you get to keep much of what you earn yes there are local taxes but the state does not impose an income tax that s why so many workers are moving to the lone star state florida is a situation there comes a point where etch auto of us has to decide what kind of country we want many americans are depressed because traditional america seems to be disappearing certainly president obama is a big government progressive guy and now he has a second term talking points doesn t expect the president to change his philosophy is he going to spend enormous amount of money on social justice and he is going to take money from successful americans in in order to finance his vision could be wrong but i don t believe that s going to help the economy very much however the president is going to do the social justice thing no matter what in texas the government does not believe that redistributing income is its responsibility all does not believe that you should micromanage the lives of its citizens if you are dumb enough to ride a motorcycle without a mel helmet and you wind up in a cemetery it's your call trust me nobody is banning 16 ounce soft drinks in waco again it goes back to everybody has a gun in california and the federal government if koop after if california and the federal government keep spending the way it's been spending both will go bankrupt before they leave office very true tax scheme bubbling under the surface so called wealth tax in france spain iceland switzerland they taxed net word of wealthy people every year doesn t matter if you earn anything or you get income or dividends doesn t matter if you have assets house gold car whatever those governments are going to take some of that uber liberals in america want to do the same thing,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121101_010000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know you would expect in a disaster this big that a president would be standing alongside and directing storm response with the governor from the state most affected by the disaster i mean generically speaking this sort of appearance is not a remarkable concept this thing becomes remarkable though to see president obama and chris christie standing together and praising one another and talking about the ways they are working together and seeing their coordinated state and federal disasters this sort of thing becomes remarkable today only because president obama is a democrat and chris christie is a republican and chris christie specifically is a republican who has been a very caustic partisan critic of president obama in his role as a campaign surrogate for mitt romney who president obama is running against in a presidential election that ends in six days mitt romney and that campaign today that campaign that chris christie has been supporting they made a somewhat remarkable decision to go ahead and keep campaigning today to get back on the campaign trail and start doing partisan campaign rallies again even while the president was still suspending his own schedule so he could respond to the storm so what we saw today in split screen was president obama departing the white house en route to storm ravaged new jersey after he stopped in at fema headquarters and at the same time mitt romney in full on campaign mode in tampa florida and then it was president obama touring coastal new jersey and comforting victims of hurricane sandy while mitt romney was holding what he called a big victory rally outside miami and while the romney campaign made sure to have their most telegenic staffers say on camera today that they were going to avoid any partisan commentary today out of respect for the storm victims they said they were going to avoid any partisan attacks on president obama on this very serious day they said they would do that but they apparently really did not mean it because at a rally in wisconsin today they had the republican party chairman talking about how america needs to fire barack obama and saying that the battle to defeat president obama is a battle for this country s freedom at a rally with mitt romney in florida today they had that state s former republican governor jeb bush talking about president obama as a failure his failure to bring this country together at the same event we had a republican state congressman tell parents that they should threaten to take halloween candy away from any children of obama supporters that they know tonight he suggested it i think the idea was he said that obama is a redistributionist and so you can scare kids and their obama supporting parents about redistribution if you steal the kids candy that was the tenor of the romney campaign today even as they told the press corps that they were going to be very respectful and nonpartisan and refrain from attacking the president today it was just a remarkable remarkable day a remarkable decision i mean president obama is expected to restart his campaign schedule tomorrow but mr romney did not want to wait for that he started his campaign events today im sorry are you stuck doing something else i ll take advantage of that i ll get back on the campaign trail im heading to florida apparently you re otherwise occupied well im not it's remarkable it is a remarkable decision to restart his campaign today but honestly it is also remarkable that mr romney never really stopped campaigning in the first place we reported yesterday on this event that mr romney held in dayton ohio yesterday afternoon it was the event that had previously been billed as a victory rally in dayton with the president off the campaign trail entirely to deal with the crisis the tromny campaign realized it would be coarse to keep campaigning the campaign s communications director put out a statement on monday saying that the romney campaign was going to be canceling all campaign events out of sensitivity to the millions of americans in the path of hurricane sandy see nthey realized like they hd to seem like they were being sensitive to the crisis but they really really wanted to hold that rally in dayton so what do you do how do you promise to cancel your political rallies in order to seem sensitive but then hold your rallies anyway well in the case of dayton yesterday and mitt romney they held the same event at the same time in the same venue with the same celebrity and they showed the same vote for mitt romney campaign video from the republican convention but they just changed the name of the event they called it a storm relief event instead of calling it a victory rally the one thing they changed materially about the campaign rally in order to make people call it a storm relief event is that they asked people to bring canned goods and groceries as donations to the red cross one of the problems with this as we talked about on last night s show is that that s not actually the right way to donate to the red cross i mean the desire to give groceries and canned goods at the time of a natural disaster comes from the right place it is a nice impulse but unless you re specifically requested by relief agencies or public officials to do that donating canned goods and groceries is just not logistically helpful s on a large scale and from across country especially if you are a presidential candidate getting national press implicitly telling the whole country this is the way to help this is what everybody ought to be doing im not just giving you my opinion on this this is explicitly what the red cross says about donations on their website they make clear under their frequently asked questions on their website that while they are grateful for any kind of thing people want to help they don t actually except donations like that the way you actually can help them is to donate blood or donate money of course having mitt romney do a photo op where people handed him money people handed him checks probably would not make as good a photo op as people handing him bags of cans so the romney campaign set up a photo op where people could hand him bags of cans buzz feed reporter mckay coffins was at that event and added some important detail today to how it all went down amazing story apparently the campaign was worried that people would not bring enough canned and stuff to donate and that would mess up their planned photo op of mitt romney carrying canned goods so quoting buzz feed the night before the event campaign aides went to a local walmart and spent 5 000 on granola bars canned foods and diapers as supporters la s lined up to the romney a young volunteer stood saying you need a donation to get in line one woman asked what if we dropped our donations off up front the volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate and said just grab something two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each and got in line when it was their turn they handed their quote donations to mr romney he took them smiled and offered an earnest thank you to be clear the romney campaign held their campaign rally called ate storm relief event they bought donations for the red cross and then they handed those donations to their own supporters in order to photograph them handing them back to mitt romney so it would look like he inspired generous donations from those people that he actually did not inspire and if they had bothered to check with the red cross they actually don t want and they certainly don t want it modeled as national behavior as for what the red cross want again the red cross for the record does not want your cans they want your money and your blood donation if you do actually want to help i don t know what it looks like in a photo op but you can text the word red cross to 90999 that will give a 10 to the red cross that you will see appear on your phone bill you can do that right now as you are watching this show text 90999 the word red cross and that actually will help you can go to redcross org and donate through their website and you can donate blood at a blood drive in your local hometown this is a real disaster this is not a plot in a sit cco about how to run for president this is a real disaster an ongoing affecting millions of americans and real help really is needed and that is not the same thing as using the suffering of millions of americans as an occasion to accrue political capital for yourself by trying to create the appearance that you are helping when you are not bothering to actually try to really help that is something very different,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121116_030000_Anderson_Cooper_360,this is interesting to me just to be clear your source is saying general petraeus knew almost immediately or felt that it was a terrorist attack knew the group involved even though he told members of congress three days after the attack that it could have been spontaneous and there s also the statement made by the director of national intelligence on the dni the end of october who put out a statement saying in the wake of criticism of ambassador rice saying that early reports indicated it might have been linked to might have been a spontaneous demonstration and ambassador rice went out on sunday saying five days after saying it was possibly early reports were spontaneous demonstration had been hijacked by other groups so if he had a gut feeling or knew i don t get why the dni would have put out that statement if petraeus was saying it was a terror attack or felt it was,0

the american presidency the case against this president from the republican side if you take only the serious criticism is essentially that things could be better yes there s been a recovery but it's not a good enough recovery yes economic progress but not good enough that republican economic proposals they are saying that the proposals this year in particular won t do what they did during the george bush years the argument from the right is if we try the republican economic proposals from the bush years again this time they will work better honestly i think that s what the case against president obama boils down to that s not always what the case against the president sounds like but that is what it boils down to i believe that s true because the rest of the case against him that you hear so much about if you re honest about it is stuff this president hasn t done they see he s raised taxes sp and he has not raised taxes when this president hasn t done anything to your guns except let you take them into national parks now they say he s doubled the deficit he s brought it down by hundreds of millions of dollars since he took office when the republicans picked as their nominee this guy a guy s who campaign book was called no apology because this guy invented the idea of an american apology tour for president obama that he wanted to run against even though he never apologized we should have known this was going to be a campaign that was going to aim its attacks against things that president obama never actually did so whether it's the deficit attack or the guns attack or the phoney religious freedom attack or the phoney apology tour attack we have ended up with a campaign that has not much been about assessing the real things that really have happened these past four years whether you agree with them or not a lot has happened these past four years it's worthy of debate it's at least worthy of appreciating four years after what you re looking at here four years after that historic night when the nation elections our first african american president we're in the position to make a decision not that will result in a historic election like that one we're in the position of making a decision that will be a national verdict on what has been a historic presidency from health reform that we have been seeking for a century to the saving of the american automobile industry to the ending of the iraq war to the killing of osama bin laden this has been a presidency of his history consequence and again it's not just because of the man himself it's because of what this particular man did in office in this particular four year period so four years ago it was grant park in chicago tomorrow night it's chicago again president obama will be at the mccormick place convention center he doesn t have other events tomorrow we will see him in chicago mitt romney will be in boston tomorrow night hoping for a different outcome than john mccain had four years ago at that sad rally in arizona before romney gets to boston he will still be on the trail in ohio and in pennsylvania before the nation renders a verdict on not just a president but a presidency whose achievements have been seen as almost beside the point in assessing whether the president gets a second term it's the virtue of this campaign or it's the damning criticism of this campaign to know that this decision has been set up for the american people as if it has very little to do with what this president has done with his last four years it's not been about his record it's been about a character kature of his record and that s why that list of things that have happened in the past four years maybe seems unfamiliar you d think after a campaign this long we could memorize that list but that s not what it's been about if barack obama gets a second term given the achievements of this past four years he will likely be enshrined as being one of the most consequential presidents if not a one term president whose political failures will overshadow what he got done in policy that s why tomorrow is such a big deal this is about one of the most consequential presidents ever and whether the achievements will be held or whether they will be clawed back this election is worth being excited about it's worth your taking part in it no matter how anybody tries this is a big deal dan rather joins us next girl hey both laugh both laugh this is hayden he s five years that s elizabeth and that s skyler and his mom nancy they're just a few of the

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,breaking news to tell you about a man with ties to al qaeda has been arrested in a federal sting operation for allegedly planning a terror attack on the federal reserve bank of new york that is according to federal authorities that say the 21 year old suspect a bangladeshi national tried to detonate what he thought was abomb the suspect faces charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to provide material support toal qaeda on now to the act of terror that killed four americans in benghazi libya going into last night s debate the administration s handling of it or mishandling as the case may be seemed like an opportunity for mitt romney here s how it played out last night,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the day after the attack governor i stood in the rose garden and told the american people and the would rl that we are going to find out exactly what happened that this was an act of terror and i also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that s when mr romney pounced latching on to mr obama s rose garden statement the day after the attack we're playing it at length so you can see the statement in context,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think it's interesting the president just said somethingwhich is that on the day after the attack he went in the rose garden and said that this was an act of terror,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,you said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror it was not a spontaneous demonstration is that what you re saying,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the bigger question is what the president meant when he said it that morning of september 12th was he referring to the terror attack the night before in benghazi as he was in the final seven paragraphs his remarks or was he speaking of what he mentioned in the paragraphs that follow the 9 11 al qaeda attacks on new york and washington the next day he used a similar phrase four days after that for days after that no one in the the administration used the phrase terrorist attack to describe what many experts believed was a terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,we mourned with the families who were lost on that day i visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sack fis in iraq and afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of arlington cemetery and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at walter reed and then last night we learned the news of this attack in benghazi as americans let us never ever forget our freedom is only sustain because there are people who are willing to fight for it stand up for it and in some cases lay down their lives for it our country s only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation today we mourn for more americans who represent the very best of the united states of america we will not waiver in our commitment to see justice is done for this terrible act make no mistake justice will be done,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,this was a highly conditional statement in the rose garden what the president said was no act of terror you write that when you want to say im not characterizing these acts this is a general state it could have been delivered 24 hours before the attacks as well as 24 hours after it was a way of putting something on the record without fully endorsing it a mild lean forward the president you can almost imagine that somebody wrote this act of terror and that was scratched out in the staffing process and replaced with the less committed formula no act of terror,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that would have the chilling effect on any further american interventions political ormilitary you say one gang somewhere could fire a few laters launch an attack on one of our consulates that means the whole thing is abad idea the green zone in iraq was shelled routinely,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121018_080000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think so in a way he did because i think that when you look at the president s rose garden statement that it really wasn t talking about that act and the reason why i don t think he was he later went on the view letterman and others and kept repeating what they had sent his u n ambassador out to say and say this was a hateful video that triggered this demonstration or we don t know what caused it look we knew we knew within hours anderson that this was a coordinated attack with heavy weapons and we now know that one of the leaders of one of the al qaeda related groups was even there it was obvious that this was not a there was no demonstration whatsoever and when they keep saying well we ll wait until we have a full and complete investigation some facts are obvious now and i d like to mention one other aspect of this if i could back in april and june there were attacks on the U.S. embassy one an i e d very serious the british ambassador was attack the british closed their consulate the red cross left was the president briefed about the danger there i don t expect him to know whether 16 people stayed or went but shouldn t he have been briefed about the deteriorating situation benghazi where it was obvious that al qaeda were coming in across the border that s what the question should be what did the president know when did he know it and what did he do about it obviously not much,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120907_000000_The_OReilly_Factor,i think it was a direct response direct attack on the church it's going out of her way to say i disagree with the values of my church remember this year no one seriously is talking about ending abortion what we're talking about is the administration s effort to expand the realm of choice by for example requiring churches to provide could not septembertive coverage to their employees regardless of the fact that it violates the deeply most held tenets of that faith we have attack on religious liberty that s masquerading as choice and miss kennedy tonight sort of threw herself on the side of those who would advocate such an attack on religious liberty,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120907_000000_The_OReilly_Factor,not only that i mean she cited her catholicism when she didn t have to this is what i don t object it her opinion she has her opinion and she wants unfettered abortion that s her opinion supreme court has ruled abortion is legal in the united states nobody is denying anybody s rights to anything but she that s a gratuitous comment she didn t have to inject she s a catholic woman and then go and say she wants no restrictions on abortion she opposes that that s offensive i believe and im frankly shocked that she would do that i don t know whether she wants to attack her own faith or not i d like to ask her about it but im taken aback,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,meares thanks good evening everyone we begin tonight with breaking news about the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in benghazi last month it was a terrorist attack U.S. ambassador chris stevens three other americans were killed security at the time of the attack was modest at best the white house has come under attack for not providing better protection just a short time ago this evening secretary of state clinton traveling in peru said the buck stops with her and she takes the blame for the assault,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,you re right the first time she talked about the attack and she talked about the harrowing night that she and other state department officials the long hour of many hour ordeal that they went through waiting to hear if chris stevens was alive waiting to hear if sean smith and others were alive i think what she was trying to do is obviously take the heat off the white house in this election everyone s talking about whether or not the president and the vice president knew about the security requests that were denied and you heard vice president biden speaking in that debate last week saying we didn t know you have secretary clinton did they throw you under the bus that s when she says no this is my state department im responsible for the security of the department she was also trying to take a little bit of the plitization out of this republicans are after the democrats the democrats are calling it a witch hunt and chris stevens father is even speaking about how his death was poe lit sized she s trying to stop political gotcha four americans wer killed ween watt to get to the bottom of what happened that night but we also need to make sure it doesn t happen again,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think that she was trying to do the things we talked about relieve the white house of some pressure i think it also strikes me as pretty clear what she was saying was pretty accurate she said look these were the decisions that were being made at a level that is clearly not the president or the vice president ask yourself anderson if today there was a request from some security professional in a consulate not even an embassy in one of the 275 outposts the united states has would that request make its way even to the secretary of state even into today s environment that s highly unlikely so the reality of the forces were decided at a lower level and natally everybody takes responsibility for it in a sense but ask yourself going forward can we tell what place in the world right now security needs to be beefed up no in retrospect it's always clear that we needed more security in the place the attack took place absolutely granted as fran knows having lived through these kind of things a certain set of circumstances occur which makes one place get attacked and at that point it's absolutely clear you have too little security looking at it at the time im not so sure it's clear the white house handled the aftermath of the crisis in an extremely clumsy manner probably incompetently that doesn t mean that the issue of whether or not they should have provided security was also handled incompetently we don t know maybe it was let s have an investigation but maybe it was just bad luck there are many threats around to U.S. outposts all over the world resources being limited you can't they may have just made a bad judgment call,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think for sure it's an effort to deflect responsibility from the white house as both elise and fareed have said her taking responsibility comes between a vice presidential debate where this came up and vice president biden handled it badly and the next presidential debate no question the timing of this is political and fareed is quite right these sources do not come up to the white house they should have no illusion that the president or vice president knew before the attack that there had been such a request i will y anderson having been there in the ten days leading up to the attack this was not bad luck im sorry this is just not possible i was there i saw the security situation everyone was aware of it that i met with including the libyan government officials i met with and so the notion that this was just could not have been foreseen and was bad luck is nonsense,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,yeah of course president obama had tons of studies that explain howhis stimulus would actually stimulate it didn t how his health care plan would reduce health care costs it hasn t every major economic decision this country has made for the past 40 years we had study upon study and guess what we're 16 trillion in debt and you can tfind a job with the hubble telescope so my point is that these studies are not the end all and be all for example the particular study that is attacking romney s tax cut does not account forgrowth,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121016_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,you re right anderson he simply can't be as aggressiveas the vice president because the town hall format doesn t allow for it there s nothing that the president s aides would like more than for him to just go after mitt romney and go after him especially on the economy that is their number one goal is to make his case on the economy and th keep describing it asromney s evasions you could say it's inconsistencies on his positions and to have the president really go at those issues but in a town hall format the president s number one goal has to be to connect with the voters in the room because those people stand in as proxies for the voters watching and he has to be able to connect and emote with those people first it's a two pronged attack first he has to prep to relate to those people in a clear and concise way and then be able to figure out how to pivot and draw contrasts with mitt romney so the president is in a bit of a bind because he has to do both things and it's a format that has much more upside for mitt romney who has been seen as this rigid unrelatable man which if he can connect with people in that room has so much more to gain than the president who if he does well tomorrow night it's sort of just a relief for them,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120925_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,keeping them honest now on a story involving the death of four distinguished americans in libya involving how well or how poorly the U.S. government handled its responsibility to protect them involving government transparency or the lack of it and lastly involving ourselves 360 and cnn have become part of the story that is the last place i or anyone in this profession ever want to be we as a program and cnn as anetwork have believed from the beginning that the focus should be on four key points on the killing of ambassador christopher stevens and three others in benghazi libya on 9 11 on what the statedepartment and others may have known about the security situation the days and weeks leading up to their killing on what leading members of the government have said about their circumstances of the tragedy and whether their statements have lacked clarity or transparency and of course on who killedthese four dedicated americans that s where we ve always believed the focus should be however because cnn discovered ambassador stevens seven page journal in what remains of the consulate in benghazi three days after the attack and because it became one source for some of our reporting questions about the use and handling of that journal have been raised as you probably heard as you probably heard thisweekend the U.S. state department spokesman blasted cnn calling the network s behavior quote disgusting and our handling of the journal quote indefensible now no one likes to be called disgusting particularly by a spokesperson for the united states state department but we do invite you and them to hold us to the same standards that we hold others and try every night to meet ourselves out of respect for his family we have not quoted from his journal not once ambassador stevens journal it was not e mailed around the newsroom as the U.S. statedepartment spokesman said it was remember cnn discovered the journal three days after the assault arwa damon one of the best war correspondents i ever worked with who reported for years at great personal risk to herself discovered the journal why was the journal significant well at the time that cnn discovered it the obama administration remember was still downplaying the possibility that this was a deliberate terrorist attack but was instead part of the violent reaction all over the arab world to that anti muslim youtube video this is what they were publicly saying then,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120925_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,now no mention there of the ambassador s journal on friday cnn received inquiries from other media outlets who somehow had gotten wind of the existence of the journal and mistakenly believed that cnn had not turned it over to the family cnn had already done so and so to be transparent on friday s broadcast i briefly mentioned the journal now throughout all of this we tried to minimize the anguish the ambassador s family is obviously feeling balanced against our journalistic duty to inform ambassador stevens held a very prominent and public position and as a news organization it's our job to inform you of information that s important this was not broadcasting gossip from the pages of someone s diary this was not reporting salacious details of someone s private life this was reporting information that could impact the national security of the united states and the safety of U.S. installations in other countries we have just learned for instance that the benghazi mission was operating under a security waiver at the time of the attack that means that typical security standards did not apply mainly because the compound was temporary in nature we don t yet know who made that decision or who was in on it but we do think that people need to know where the process brokedown if it broke down we think you need to know what happened to U.S. personnel in benghazi we ve got a lot to talk about tonight with former homeland security adviser fran towsend as we often mention fran s a member of the external advisory committee and recently visited libya with her employer also joining us former cia officer bob baer i don t want to get into the journalistic details with you but there s no doubt what do you make of the fact that this consulate in benghazi three days after the attack apparently wasn t being guarded and journalists are wandering all over the place and anybody could have been wandering all over the place,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120925_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,anderson i think the whole thing s just outrageous i completely agree with fran look that consulate was overrun and we don t even begin to understand what was lost there we ve lost crypto files money personal documents we don t even know this administration is not tellingus the fact that the diary was found in the consulate and the fact that there wasn t i ve heard that there s a quick reaction force tried to get to the consulate but was attacked at the airport benghaziairport this hasn t been confirmed but what s happened in libya we ve lost complete control of this every investigation i ve been involved in whetherassassination or blown up embassy there s always been a local force or marines to secure the site otherwise the fbi can't do its work it just can't if it's completely wrecked like it was in benghazi and i think the reason that the state department is so sensitive aboutyour finding the journal is because they ve lost control,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the best we can tell this is the first time any administration official has uttered the word planned to describe what happened asked how long it took to reach his conclusion secretary panetta said quote it took awhile once information from benghazi came back but keeping them honest multiple sources now tell 360 that officials knew this was a terror attack almost from the get go within 24 hours at least intelligence officials yet this is what they were saying for more than a week publicly after the killing,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,it's in a standoff anderson because the fbi and the military have decided they have to go in with extra protection the military wanted to send in a special package which would have included counter battery because remember the annex was attacked by mortars this was a military attack well planned the military and the fbi don t know what they're up against in benghazi and they have to go you know with a lot of force on the ground,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,reporter well anderson the embassy in tripoli here has really been on high alert since the attack in benghazi they evacuated nonessential staff and travel within tripoli has been really restricted for the remaining staff the concern here among the western community in tripoli and diplomats i earlier spoke with a security advisor for one of the western diplomatic commission and they say they're concerned about the demonstrations that are expected tomorrow in tripoli there are also other demonstrations also in benghazi but he said that a senior libyan security official in tripoli told his mission that they were worried about the possibility of these protests turning violent tomorrow but anderson these are not anti american or anti western protests they are protests a continuation of what we saw in benghazi last friday people taking to the streets putting pressure on the government to disband militias and create security forces they actually protest against extremism but we did see these protests turn violent last friday and there is that concern that could happen tomorrow in tripoli we did see the U.S. embassy this evening posting on its website a warning for U.S. citizens in tripoli and in benghazi who remain in country to avoid the two main squares in these cities because of the demonstrations saying that while they are expected to be peaceful protests that they can be unpredictable and could turn violent,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,bob as i said earlier we heard leon panetta the defense secretary using the wordplanned we think that s the first time we ve heard that from administration officials you say the way in which the mortars were used in this attack would right away lead to that conclusion,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well it's very hard to walk in mortars on a targe and apparently as i hear they were hit the annex very quickly by mortars so somebody had the exact coordinates somebody knew how to fire mortars direct fire and i think that s what has the pentagon concerned that this was a military style attack and the people who did attack itknew what they were doing and you know in defense of the secretary of defense the details are coming in very slowly simply because it's been difficult to get people out of the country the debriefings have gone slowly and we can't put people on the ground because of the security situation so the truth has come out very slowly even inside our government,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,fran a lot of people are being critical of the administration to play devil s advocate here it's one thing for politicians who are not part of the government to say or not part of the administration to saywell look we should have known this earlier it's another thing for administration officials to come out in front of an investigation and say oh it was a terrorist attack there was a level of caution that an administration official would have that a congressman would not who is more critical,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,senator john mccain is a long time supporter of freedom for libya he supported president obama s actions to remove gadhafi he s been critical of how the administration has handled the benghazi aftermath we spoke earlier today take a look wh do you make of the response by the administration in the early days of ambassador rice and now what they're saying now they're now saying it was a terrorist attack the president did use the word terror early on in the rose garden but we heard from ambassador rice who is saying link this to the video what do you see as going on,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i see a fundamental misunderstanding in the larger picture and then on the smaller picture in the smaller picture they were either incredibly naive or willfully deceiving the american people i don t know which but to think an attack of this nature with heavy weapons mortars and a very sophisticated direct fire and indirect fire that somehow that could be the result of a spontaneous demonstration is just impossible for me to understand,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,let me just throw in a third option though which supporters of the administration would say is look they want to be cautious about how they characterize it early on and so they were you know taking a go slow approach and saying not jumping the gun and saying it was a terrorist attack but basically kind of wanted to see where the investigation led,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,a casual observer a first year cadet at west point will tell you that that kind of attack is not a spontaneous demonstration here darling let s go to a demonstration bring the mortars this is it's insane that they would somehow believe that could be the result of a spontaneous demonstration second of all they ve got it all wrong when they blame the video it's not the video it is the people the islamists radical islamists that are pushing this video throughout media in the middle east to crank up the anti moderate anti pro democracy force,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,there was reporting yesterday from fran townsend at cnn and also a writer for the daily beast who said intelligence sources he had talked to said in the intelligence community it was within the first 24 hours they were saying this was a terrorist attack even had some people identified have you heard that can you comment on that and if that is the case why does information that the intelligence community has notsomething the administration is saying publicly,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i don t know but it doesn t take intelligence information to watch an operation take place with heavy weapons mortars that is not then a spontaneousdemonstration this is why it's reprehensible for our ambassador to the u n to go on all networks and say and deny that it flies in the face of thefacts so i don t know what intelligence we had or what we didn t have but i know that when you have that kind of operation even the most casual observer knows that it is a terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think it tells me that over time the details always come out im not sure what we can really be gained in immediate investigation of the kind you re talking about because the crime scene is basically so badly compromised but over time we will there were intercepts there were other information there s some information that convinced the president of the legislative assembly to go on our nationwide tv and say we know it's al qaeda now i don t know that but it was clearly a terrorist attack and the administration described it as not being so they owe the american people an explanation,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well the capability from our perspective would probably set up a nuclear arms race in the middle east it would greatly impair our ability to respond to terrorist attacks say from lebanon or gaza if we defend ourselves whether iran could break out and use a nuclear weapon and it could do so in a small room somewhere put this bomb together this is a country half the size of europe there s a good chance you re not going to know where that room is what we're saying is the one part of this nuclear program that we can see because there s a warhead part there s a weapon part there s a missile part the one part that we can see is the enrichment program and it is observable it is vulnerable we can target it and we want to show literally on that line that process of enrichment where we can stopiran in its tracks so it will not get a weapon and the major issue here is not when iran gets a bomb or even when it decides to get a bomb the major issue is when what is the last point at which we can act to prevent iran from getting a bomb,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well i think the first thing was that the deadline has been pushed back to six to nine months which means there s not going to be an attack during the elections which from the white house point of view is a great relief but we ve got a very serious issue on the table the next president that is the israelis are telling the united states look the red line is when the iranians get the technological capability to build a bomb we then feel we have to attack previously the united states government has been telling israel no the red line should be when they actually get a bomb,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think so it should be the issue is so much more important than whether they sit down together i think the fact they didn t sit down together signals the lack of harmony between them the personal harmony between them but they do talk a lot they just have very differentpoints of view the united states really does not want to get into a conflict with iran and when you talk to the israelis they thought there was well over 50 chance that israel was going to use force to attack in the next six to nine months,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121022_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,chris let me tell you what i heard from the intelligence officials and then you and your viewers can decide their intelligence is that some of the people who attacked the compound on the night of september 11 had been watching the events in cairo live they had been watching al jazeera or whatever network it was showing the protests at the american embassy in cairo about the video they also know that in addition to watching this they talked among themselves about what was happening in cairo and then they went to the consulate compound they don t have intelligence that has them planning specifically what they would do or why they would go that unfortunately is still a missing piece of the puzzle but that s what leads them to say there was some link between what happened in cairo and these people gathering at the compoundand then assaulting it,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121003_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,that s newt gingrich saying he s not a real president and also he s lazy and has rhythm newt gingrich is the one who called president obama the food stamps president it was gingrich who suggested a line of attack portraying president obama as the welfare president specifically the lazy vick ticks who are dependent on the government at least it was before those remarks were made public still a bit of a surprise that the romney campaign bit on mr gingrich s idea that they took that advice but they did take that advice the ream campaign has been running ads accused president obama of gutting welfare reform by removing its work requirements president obama did not do that but the romney ads a lot of them now say he did they show white americans working hard and they say this president wants to take your hard earned money and give it away to lazy welfare recipients who aren t working it's not true as a matter of policy but that s how the romney campaign has been running against obama he repeated the lie to cnn just last week there was a moment back in may when it became a scandal that a pro mitt romney super pac had even been pitched the idea of bringing jeremiah wright back as an attack on president obama that ad campaign was never picked up by the pro romney super pac or the romney campaign itself it was a scandal they had even been asked to pick up something that racially charged but a few months later the campaign picked up the welfare nonsense campaigning in a way that s divorced from the facts but that s loaded with enough sub text to knock you over in a still wind and they picked up newt gingrich surrogate in his food stamps attack no and now fox news and the pro mitt romney drudge report just are going full bore on the jeremiah wright stuff as o of right now in 2008 the john mccain had a choice about whether or not they should campaign on really overtly racial appeals things like the jeremiah wright attack they chose not to in 2008 if the romney campaign is going to keep going there along with the the conservative media can it work this year would it have worked in 2008 what are the lessons from john mccain having not gone there in 2008 when he had the chance the senior strategist from 2008 joins us next,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,mitt romney s campaign had this to say about this video in addition to starting up new businesses mitt romney helped build bain capital by turning around broken companies creating and saving thousands of jobs the problem today is president obama hasn t been able to turnaround the economy in the same way here s the problem for mitt romney though kristen which is these were two areas really the economy and his record at bain that were supposed to be the strong points for the romney campaign and they're now being used as his vulnerabilities his weak points unless he can turn this round you can't blame the obama campaign they are ramping this up now and attacking him on the very things he thought that he was going to win on,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,but this isn t really surprising at all you already began to see the attacks on his bain record starting in the reblican primary this is something the campaign has been prepared for from day one they have known that every single piece of his business record was going to be gone through these ads sort of going after his bain record have been airing in swing states relentlessly i really think that this sort of thing is already baked in if you already think that romney s record at bain is the reason that you don t want him to be president you have already made up your mind if you think that his record at ceo of bain shows that he was a good executive and that he was able to start and grow companies then you see it as a positive i don t think that adding even more layers on to the bain issue is going to change people s minds i think what s going to change people s minds is what s obama or romney going to do to make the next four years,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120928_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,it's a huge problem precisely because it's in his own words if this was just an attack by the obama campaign and obama was standing in front of the camera saying this is what i think about what he did at bain it's a very different thing but using words like harvesting what does that make the people who lost their jobs the chaff wh does that make them this is the worst kind of abusive language that you can possibly imagine,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121026_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,exactly it wasn t just the attack ads it was the choice of his running mate he chose a very idealogical running mate and it was the positions he took in the republican primary and the view always was as some of romney s senior campaign people said that after the primary he would have to pivot into a more moderate position it took him longer to do that than i think he had hoped but with the first debate he did that and i think the reason why you know if the romney campaign is watching your show tonight piers they're saying get that british guy to stop talking about rape and abortion we don t want to talk about it we like moderate mitt we don t want to talk about these issues we want women to be focused,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,right after that i did turn around and say you re totally correct but they spent two weeks telling us this was about a tape that there was a riot outside the banghazi consulate he was right in the main i just think he picked the wrong word to factcheck the president so we correct the record yes it is true the president did utter the words in the rose garden acts of terror the day after the banghazi assaults however he did so only after he referenced 9 11 2001 and if he really intended to call banghazi an act of terror why in that very same speech for the very first time in public did he blame the event on a youtube movie trailer movie that s the same youtube video that he wanted us tok believe sparked an impromptu riot which by definition is not a premeditated terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,sean blaming the video and apologizing for hurting the feelings of radical extremists continued not just for days but for weeks after this attack and through it all the president was asked and asked repeatedly if this was an act of terror and he flat out refused to say yes in other words he lied at that debate last night and the cover up continues and so does the president s deliberate indifference to matters of national security now we ve hammered the president for attending a fundraiser in vegas the day after that libya attack today after the news broke the feds foiled a blow to blow up the federal reserve building by a muslim extremist how does the president respond with a full day of campaigning including events tonight joining me with reaction is former speaker of thes house newt gingrich welcome back,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,let me play for you including joy behar this is 14 full days after the terrorist attack just a little montage of the president blaming the internet video and refusing to say five days after he had his ambassador to the u n saying it jay carney saying it wasn t a terrorist attack nine days and 14 days after the president refused to acknowledge it's a terrorist attack watch this,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,sean 14 days after the attack still couldn t say it was an act of terror but we now know they knew within 24 hours what does this mean for you,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,two different things one is in a very serious way what is there about barack obama s psychology that makes it so difficult for him to deal with the reality of islamic extremism why is it always somebody in america s fault why is he always apologizing for islamic extremists i think this is a very serious question about the whole nature of his approach to that part of the world from the united nations ambassador as you pointed out telling the american people a falsehood on the sunday after the attack to vice president biden on a national debate who repeatedly misleading the american people to the president last night completely misleading the american people question here that you have a president of the united stateswho is commander in chief will not be honest with himself about the problem of radical islam will not be honest with the world about it his united nations speech was a disgrace for an american president to go to the u n and apologize six times for a youtube video by some nut case first of all we should be defending the right of free speech we should be saying to the muslim world yes if you want to be in the modern world guess what you re not going to have islamic supremacy not able to dictate to the rest of us you re not going to have an american president census owner eor on your behalf yet the obama state department has gone in the opposite direction meeting with muslim groups and promised in effect to try to censor americans,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,sean and fort hood was workplacfv violence and terror attacks a man caused disaster there s something wrong go ahead,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,three or four things wrong with this first of all i was told that the U.S. government paid 70 000 of our tax paid money to put this on pakistani to make it and put it on pakistani television if you re the average taxpayer you wonder about the deficit what a waste ever your money what an outrage to have this kind of thing put on with your money second they don t believe in religious liberty when they're attacking the catholic church ask cardinal dolan about the war on religion being waged by the obama administration they only believe in religious liberty when they're apologizing to islamist to things that might offend them third it's not senseless violence s this is the heart of what s wrong with the entire obama approach if you are al qaeda and you have an opportunity to kill an american ambassador that is from their standpoint a very intelligent rational thing to do it's precisely the inability of president obama and his team to come to grips with the fact that we are at war with an extremist movement on a worldwide basis that wants to kill us so from their perspective this isn t random senseless violence this is a deliberate when 100 people get organized to attack your consulate that s not senseless that s terrorism,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,when people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns there were no protests why did that go on,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,what were you first told about the attack why were people talking about protests when people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns there were no protests why did that go on for weeks,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community the intelligence community told us that we said exactly what the intelligence community toda tols that they knew that was the assessment as the intelligence community the day after the attack governor i stood in the rose garden and i told the american people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened that this was anñ act true mr president then why days later would you again not call it terror when asked by univision then later on the view with joy behar why after the debate in private did you tell the very man that asked you that question last night that it took you so long to call it's a still gathering more information s common of this adds up to the truth president obama joining me now with more fox news contributor liz cheney so this is like finger pointing every student is blaminthe state depan real time the intelligence community knew within 24 hours none of this is adding up in any way except this is a major cover up,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,it's a lot easier to keep your story straight sean when you re telling the truth clearly they can't keep their story straight because they're not telling the truth to the american people here either the president was lying last night or the president spent ten days after he first declared it according to him an act of terror lying to the american people saying it was caused by a video but win of those two things has got to be true and clearly the president and vice president biden seemed to have been getting different information it is a mess it's a mess because they're trying to cover up the fact that it was a terrorist attack because if they admit that al qaeda s resurgent that al qaeda was involved in attacking our consulate and killing our ambassador then the president can no longer claim to be this effective national security leader,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,i think it will have a significant impact a lot of people say we're focused on the economy focused on jobs that s true i would make two points one is the president s record on national security is at least as bad as his record on the economy and jobs secondly the american people don t appreciate a commander in chief who lies to them we're now to point where we ve got to be very clear that that s what s happening here the president is not being honest with the american people i think the voters won t think highly of a man who wants to be re elected who can't be counted on to tell them the truth about something as important as a terrorist attack that kills an ambassador and three other americans,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,greta tonight grizzly attacks and constant interruptions president obama and mitt romney got the voters attentions but did they get their votes,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121018_040000_Hannity,mitt romney had a fantastic first debate he laid outs a vision for the country what we saw was we were able to cut through the clutter of all these 30 second attack ads and we saw a leader last night the same thing,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121017_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,that s a profound fact cal question chris im tempted to say he has to do all three but if i had to pick one i would at this point pick the upbeat message as i understand it the loose change out there the undecided voters in places like colorado and ohio and virginia and so on are women suburban women working women i think they want more of a positive message they want a unifying message they want optimism and strength if the president can embody optimism and strength the way he did four years ago i think that s his best way to go let others carry the attack let bill clinton give bill clinton the job of trying to dismantle mitt romney let other people do that and you barack obama try to be the guy that you were four years ago updated wiser stronger more sophisticated than you were,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121017_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,let s watch that point we saw a dramatic face off between mitt romney and president obama over that attack in libya which was so tragic we lost chris stevens and three others let s watch,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121017_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,i think it's interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack he went in the rosegarden and said that this was an act of terror,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121017_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,you said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror it was not a spontaneous demonstration is that what you re saying,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121017_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,i want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called attack inbenghazi an act of terror,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121008_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,the big catalyst for protests at the moment in the middle east was the video that was released which mocked the profit mohammed as a result there was an attack as you know on the american embassy in ben zazi and libya the ambassador christopher steven was murdered do you condemn the attack which caused his murder,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121008_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,translator i believe that you can under no circumstances justify the condemnation and the attack upon a country in order to reach a single terroristgroup and i do believe that no matter how long you and i or other people speak this is unexplainable allow me to ask you do you believe that the various administrations of the united states were successful in eradicating terrorism they haven t been has the problem been resolved or has it gotten worse,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121008_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,my answer would be clearly it was partially successful in the sense that al qaeda has been unable to commit another attack of that magnitude since and again i come back to if you were the president of iran and that attack happened in tehran it wouldn t have been acceptable to your people for you to do nothing,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121008_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,translator not at all surely we would have pursued the perpetrators not to seek an entire nation but i ask you this during the last ten years during the last decade how many american forces were lost and killed in afghanistan and iraq even today even right now they're still losing their lives has the situation improved clearly not how can you say that it has improved now the activities of theterrorists have trespassed into the borders of pakistan in iraq and afghanistan over a million people have been killed or injured we are incredibly saddened that over 3 000 people were killed in the united states the iranian government immediately condemned those brutal attacks and i told you we are against even the killing of one individual why should human lives be taken innocent humans anywhere in the world but in order to avenge the blood of 3 000 people a million people shouldn t give theirlives some of the behaviors of the united states in our region encourages extremism perhaps because they don t know the people so they do need to reform their behavior there was no need for 5 000 or6 000 U.S. young men and women to lose their lives,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,tonight the mixed messages from the obama administration are now closely resembling flat out lies to you the american people a major scandal is develop in the wake of last week s assault on the U.S. embassy in benghazi four americans are dead and still this president is refuse to go come clean about what happened and more importantly who was to blame after more than a week of denying this was a premeditated salt the white house has reversed its position saying it is quote self evident tend it was a terrorist attack that remark came that jay carney today and it was self evident to any objective observer that it was all the work of al qaeda from the very beginning the only people denying that the last week is people like jay carney they wanted us to believe the afascinations of the ambassador stevens and navy seals were the quote of a movie trailer this had nothing to do with the anniversary of the 9 11 attacks but as more facts about the tragedy were revealed that story began to change and contradictions began piling up let s review,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a preplanned premeditated attack that what happened initially it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in cairo as a consequence of the video,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,all right now how this event can evolve from an impromptu riot about a youtube video to a premeditated terrorist attack in a span of a week it can be explained one of three ways number one this administration is stupid simple as that number two this administration is on the receiving end of some of the worst intelligence in american history or number three we are witnessing a wide spread coverup based on flat out lies all aimed to protect the president who happens to be running for re election im going for number three and in a moment im going to show you the evidence to back it up but this is not the first time the anointed one and his teams have been less than truthful for years they have been lying to you about the republican party republicans want dirty air dirty water they lied about kids with autism and the elderly having to fend for themselves they lied about mitt romney being a tax cheat and even worse a murder we have a president who will not come clean about the security lapses that resulted in the death of four brave americans and all of the mainstream media wants to do is cover up for their president they are more interested in whining about the timing of governor romney s statement was he ten seconds too early but at least he had the courage to denounce the anti american violence that was erupting overseas mitt romney had the courage to call out these extremists for what they were a clear threat to this country and that s more than i can say for an administration whose first reaction to the events of last week were anywhere between ten to sixteen hours depending on which timeline you believe in for hurting the feelings of anyone offended by a low budget movie trailer that nobody watched that was released in july joining me more reaction is the former new hampshire governor i call him a one man romney supporting wrecking crew the one and only john is back,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,governor it gets worse if you can believe this jay carney told the country on behalf of the president today it was self evident this was a terror attack the president for the first time because he never does any real interviews he goes on letterman and hang out with beyoncé and jay z he doesn t get tough questions he wouldn t come on this program if his life agained on it so he was asked on often vision tonight he was asked the question why didn t we have beefed up security and he contradicts his own statement he s back to blaming the movie trailer,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,think about this not only are they lying maybe to protect his chances for re election but we had a terror attack that killed americans governor and the lie would protect al qaeda from being exposed for perpetrating this attack help me out here,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120921_040000_Hannity,first of all the mainstream media has helped the obama administration wane a nine day disinformation campaign and now the o team is caught up in our own web of deception these attacks weren t spontaneous outrage over some internet video it was all very carefully planned including what happened to benghazi and unfortunately the mainstream media isn t asking the kind of questions that would get to the bottom of it for example what was our ambassador to bringly doing in benghazi on the anniversary of 9 11 no one seems to me,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120921_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,reporter well the prime minister was telling us they do in fact at this stage believe this was a pre planned attack that this was not a spontaneous event that did take place they're saying that so far they have eight people in custody who were directly linked to this attack and that they are in pursuit of others especially in pursuit of the leadership however those individuals who perpetrated this assault are not linked to any one particular group rather they are something of a coalition of individuals with different affiliations all of them of course having this extremist vein running within them but that they are individuals who are loosely banded together and so the government in hot pursuit of them at this point in time telling us they are determined to bring them to justice,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120921_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,let me go to elise U.S. government officials are now conceding it was in fact a terrorist attack but they're not saying it was pre planned is that right,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120921_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that s right wolf what they're saying is they didn t have any quote actionable intelligence that the consulate was indeed being targeted or diplomats were indeed being targeted but that s very different wolf than saying that there was no chatter out there that they weren t aware of the threat and they say it wasn t pre planned but the level of sophistication and the number of people that were there heavily armed would cause one to think that there was some kind of coordination what U.S. officials think is maybe there wasn t necessarily a plan to attack the consulate on any particular day but that there were a group of extremists that were looking for a target of opportunity they saw something going on at the embassy and they were ready to go and they went for it wolf,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120921_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,arwa there s an investigation going on in libya in the wake of the attack the prime minister saying he s determined to bring those responsible to justice but how easy of a task is that in a country like libya right now,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120921_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well wolf we're hearing a couple of things first of all the officials are saying that just because the detail of ambassador stevens in tripoli wasn t visible doesn t mean it wasn t there but when we're talking about the consulate in tripoli in benghazi excuse me officials say that in the wake in the lead up to this 9 11 attack and arwa just mentioned these previous attacks including the attack on the consulate the state department made increased enhancements to improve security on the compound more barriers more cameras additional armed guards in addition ambassador stevens had two armed guards in addition to three others and several militias on the compound and what officials are saying is listen we were adding improvements to this securitybased on those previous attacks which weren t very large but they say they couldn t have foreseen wolf the kind of onslaught that happened on 9 11 and they don t know if they could have done anything to prevent it,0

invitation thank you for your extraordinarily warm welcome ann and i appreciate your friendship very very much thank you now al you are right a campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes we blue jeans in the morning perhaps suits for a lunch fund raiser sport coat for dinner but it's nice to finally relax and wear what ann and i wear around the house im glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition of course im pleased that the president s here we were chatting pleasantly this evening as if tuesday night never happened and i credit that of course to the cardinal it's taken new york s highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior i was actually hoping the president would bring joe biden along this evening because he ll laugh at anything of course this isn t a night for serious politics and it was especially nice to see president obama and cardinal dolan sharing the dais despite their differences im sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president s wine turns into water or for that matter whether my water turns into wine im pleased to once again have the chance to see governor cuomo who s already being talked about for higher office a very impressive fellow but he may be getting a little ahead of himself i mean let me get this straight the man has put in one term as a governor he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that s enough to run for president of course we're down to the final months of the president s term as presidents as president obama surveys the waldorf banquet room with everyone in white tie and finery you have to wonder what he s thinking so little time so much to redistribute and don t be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers he knows how to seize the moment this president and already has a compelling new campaign slogan you re better off now than you were four weeks ago you know with or without all the dignitaries that are here the al smith dinner surely lives up to its billing usually when i get invited to gatherings like this it's just to be the designated driver your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the catholic church i have special admiration for the apostle st peter to whom it is said upon this rock i will build my church the story is more inspiring when you consider he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say if you got a church you didn t build that of course only 19 days to go until the finish line campaign full of surprises the debates are very surprising just the other night we had a fun debate candy crowley was there and help to welcome us people seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates let me tell you what i do first refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate second find the biggest available strawman and then just mercilessly attack it big bird didn t even see it coming and by the way and in the spirit of sesame street the president s remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter o and the number 16 trillion campaigns can be a grueling exhausting president obama and i are each very lucky to have one person who s always in our corner someone who we can lean on and someone who s a comforting presence without whom we wouldn t be able to go another day i have my beautiful wife ann he has bill clinton we got a big dose of the biden charm last week i ll tell you that in his debate with paul ryan im not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that joe intended because afterwards i heard from the federal election commission from now on whenever he appears on tv there s a recording of me afterwards that says im mitt romney and i approve this message of course rules of fairness have to be enforced because what other safeguard do we have besides the press and applause now i never suggest that the press is biased i recognize they have their job to do and i have my job to do my job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country and their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it applause let s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things when suddenly i pulled ahead in some of the major polls what was the headline polls show obama leading from behind and i ve already seen early reports from tonight s dinner headline obama embraced by catholics romney dines with rich people applause of course the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church there have been some awkward moments like when the president pulled pope benedict aside to share some advice on how to deal with his critics he said look holy father whatever the problem is just blame it on pope john paul ii of course the president has found a way to take the sting out of the obama care mandates for the church for now on they're going to be in latin we have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me he and i of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest it would be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty but fortunately we don t carry the burden of disliking one another our president has had some very fine and gracious moments don t tell anyone i said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud you can oppose applause in our country you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will and that s how it is for me there s more to life than politics at the al smith foundation and the archdiocese of new york you show this in the work you do in causes that run deeper that allegiance to party or to any contest of the moment no matter which way the political winds are blowing what work goes on day in day out by this organization and you you answer with calm and willing hearts and service to the poor and care for the sick in defense in the rights of conscious and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born you strive to bring god s love into every life applause i don t presume to have all your support and a night like this im certainly not going to ask for it but you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that i stand proudly with you as an ally and friend god bless you all and god bless the united states of america thank you,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121019_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,thank you everyone please take your seats otherwise clint eastwood will yell at them thank you to al governor miss romney governor cuomo mayor bloomberg senator schumer all the distinguished guests who are here in less than three weeks voters in states like ohio virginia and florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question what are we doing here of course new yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years tonight i am here with a man whose father was a popular governor and who knows what it's like to run a major northeastern state and who could very well be president someday and im hoping it is andrew cuomo this is the third time that governor romney and i have met recently as some of you may have noticed i had a lot more energy in our second debate i felt really well rested after the nice long nap i had in the first debate although it turns out millions of americans focused in on the second debate who didn t focus in on the first debate and i happened to be one of them i particularly want to apologize to chris matthews four years ago i gave him a thrill up his leg this time around i gave him a stroke of course there s a lot of things i learned from that experience for example i learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift so take note gentlemen now win or lose this is my last political campaign so im trying to drink it all in unfortunately mayor bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it that s okay im still making the most of my time in the city earlier today i went shopping at some stores in midtown i understand governor romney went shopping for some stores in midtown and it brought back some great memories because some of you know i went to school here in new york had a wonderful experience here used to love walking through central park loved to go to old yankees stadium the house that ruth built although he really did not build that i hope everybody s aware of that it's been four years since i was last at the al smith dinner i have to admit some things have changed since then i ve heard some people say barack you re not as young as you used to be where s that golden smile where s that pep in your step and i say settle down joe im trying to run a cabinet meeting here he does smile when he says it though tomorrow it's back to campaigning i visit cities and towns across our great country and i hear the same thing everywhere i go honestly we were hoping to see michelle and i have to admit it can be a grind sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever but paul ryan assured me that we ve only been running for 2 hours and 50 something minutes of course the economy s on everybody s minds the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since i took office i don t have a joke here i just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since i took office and we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds just the other day honey boo boo endorsed me so that s a big relief ultimately though tonight s not about the disagreements governor romney and i may have it's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names actually mitt is his middle name i wish i could use my middle name and even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight we're both thinking ahead of our final debate on monday im hoping that governor romney and i will have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of americans watching at home is this happening again when are they putting on the voice monday s debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy spoiler alert we got bin laden applause of course world affairs are a challenge for every candidate after some of you guys remember after my foreign trip in 2008 i was attacked as a celebrity because i was so popular with our allies overseas and i have to say im impressed with how well governor romney has avoided that problem just so everyone knows in our third debate we won t spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other we will also interrupt the moderator just to mix things up and finally let me say that i ve been doing some thinking and i ve decided that for our final debate im going to go back to the strategy i used to prepare for the first debate im just kidding im trying to make axelrod sweat a little bit get him a little nervous in all seriousness i couldn t be more honored to be here this evening im honored to be with leaders of both the private and public sectors and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the catholic church it's written in scripture applause it's written in scripture that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope this country s fought through some very tough years together and while we still have a lot of work ahead we ve come as far as we have mainly because the perseverance and character of ordinary americans and it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season opposing candidates can share the same stage people from both parties can come together applause come together to support a worthy cause and i particularly want to thank governor romney for joining me because i admire him very much as a family man and a loving father and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones so applause we may have different political perspectives but i think in fact im certain that we share the hope that the next four years will have the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening may we all in the words of al smith do our full duty as citizens god bless you god bless your families and may god bless the united states of america thank you very much,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121019_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,well yes but sort of in the reverse from the way it was reported earlier and the way susan rice initially described it rather than it ak spontaneous protest outside the embassy gates or the mission gates mirroring the one earlier in theday in cairo are this has emerged quite clearly as a planned attack which was likely inspired by anger over the video but a group of militants who saw their opportunity and took it and then once the gates were breached and there was an actual attack going on a protest followed so there was a protest there was a video involved there was an atablg but the order appears to have been reversed,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121115_090000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,we all remember that because of what happened at the end there mr romney s face plant failed attempt at calling the president out for something that the conservative media said he had done that he had not actually done but what happened right before that at that debate was president obama defending susan rice and hillary clinton directly by their titles and condemning as offensive mitt romney trying to say that that attack was being covered up or that the country was being misled about it that is what we saw again today on full blast at the president s first press conference after being re elected the beltway common wisdom on this is that president obama is picking a fight with his secretary of state nomination if he does pick susan rice for that position and when the beltway accuses you of picking a fight they always mean oh no no you shouldn t do that but seeing the president up there talking about this today with such fire in the belly and seeing as he did that as well in the debate when the same subject came up i think this may be something more than just picking a fight there s plenty of reason to be angry to be concerned about the attack on the U.S. consulate in libya it is very much worth being angry about the people who carried out that attack right it is worth talking about it's worth even being angry about why american preparations for something like this happening at an american diplomatic facility were not enough to protect the lives of the four americans who died including the ambassador those are the questions the congressional committee s looking at that attack are going to be asking tomorrow when those hearings convene including expected from david petraeus himself who is now the former head of the cia but what does not follow rationally from the anger and concern over the attack in september is that john mccain and conservative media assaults on the american ambassador to the united nations susan rice who had nothing to do with the attack or with anything about preparing consular facilities for potential security problems but who john mccain has nevertheless been furiously denouncing as unqualified and as a person who doesn t understand things well enough like he does he went on cbs today and called her not very bright which you will recall is the exact same thing that john sununu said about president obama and his role in the mitt romney campaign he called him not very bright the president s response to john mccain s attempted destruction of susan rice and his pledge to block her nomination and mccain s pledge to block her nomination as secretary of state the president s response to that has not been to say i don t want to talk about benghazi nothing to see here his reaction has been to say yes we should talk about what happened in libya but the idea that susan rice is going to be your scapegoat here when she has done nothing wrong that s the part that is nonsense and im not going to go along with that and you re not using something made up about her to destroy a career that is still on its way up picking a fight is what they're calling this in the beltway media right picking a fight would be installing paul krugman at treasury picking a fight would be like picking eliot spitzer for attorney general picking a fight would be moving camp david to hawaii so the president could get in more beach time picking susan rice for secretary of state if the president decides he wants to do that would not be picking a fight it would be more drawing a line in the sand it would say starting now starting day one of this second term that i just won in a big national election that you lost starting now we will fight about policy we will fight about differences of opinion we will fight about priorities but we will not have anymore fights based on nonsense that the right made up to entertain itself if we have a real beef we will fight it out but if it's made up that made up stuff will no longer be entertained at the level of national policy joining us now is bill bergman a senior strategist for a pro obama super pac he previously served as the deputy press secretary for this president and for national press secretary for mr obama s campaign in 2008 mr burton congratulations,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_210000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,well he s speaking to the wrong audience in going after obama care chris i think the attack on obama care worked to some extent in the 2010 congressional races when they focused on the fact that some tax money would be necessary and that some medicare spending would be cut remember that s what they used in 2010 and that worked but the people that worked with were not the seniors that worked with swing voters and younger voters who were you know looking at how that was going to play out so i think to go into the teeth of the activists at the aarp with that argument was going to e lice sit boos you knew that was going tohappen again you ask why would they want to do that kind of thing why would they want to get booed at the aarp i can't imagine any positive this is not like a sister souljah moment from the clinton years it makes no political sense whatsoever,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121006_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i think the debate certainly does americans watched those debates that may not watch the next two that saw a mitt romney that was a direct contradiction to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of attack ads especially in swing states that the obama campaign has spent painting mitt romney as some kind of insensitive clueless bank accounts at the cayman islands kind of guy and he wiped all that away and also i think it was pretty clear that for the first time the president was put on the defensive as far as his record is concerned and that s because of this bubble he s been in for the last four years and he obviously couldn t defend it finally piers i thought one of the seminal moments in that debate was near the end when jim lehrer talked about the lack of bipartisanship the lack of sitting down together and averting this fiscal cliff that most americans know we're headed towards and mitt talked about being governor of massachusetts reaching across the aisle having to negotiate et cetera the president s responses sometimes you have to say no to people is that you know and the fact is first two years as mitt pointed out first two years of his presidency they just rammed things through without a single republican vote so i think those were that makes it probably one of the really more important debates in american history and perhaps im exaggerating because im so happy,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121006_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i think so piers but you know it would sound like i am now trying to rewrite history or i would have done better you know i never tried to do any of that looking back and certainly not in anger or bitterness but i thin it is true that during the 2008 campaign the president or then senator obama had no record to defend and one of the reasons why mitt did so well in this debate was because mitt was i think very legitimately attacking his record whether it be the 90 billion in subsidies for energy or a number of the other things that he pointed the failure of dodd frank and so the president had a record to defend this time but one do not underestimate the president of the united states he will come back strong i think mitt has to be prepared for that and also as you mentioned these job numbers will give him a bit or something of a boost today,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,sean that s a blatant lie because we now have proof of the quote initial information deliver to the white house was that this was an act of terror they knew within hours in addition fox has learn that the two navy seals who were killed at the annex one kilometer from the consulate died approximately 7 hours after the attack began now liz cheney will join me in the next segment with some very serious questions about why forces were not deployed to save their lives and whether or not it's possible that the president of the united states went to bed on the night of september 11 knowing that americans were under siege and fighting for their lives in libya we will have more on that with liz cheney ahead but first here to talk about the developments and how they could impact this election the author of the new new york times best seller mugged racial demagoguery from the 70s to obama ann coulter is here how are you,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,sean let s look at what they have told us now that we know that they knew they knew everything within hours of the attack and white house knew we have the proof when is the media going to call them out should we see this video of what happened in benghazi should we see it before the election watch some of their excuses,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,i claimed that was a mohammed submerged in urine hoping the museum officials would come out and deny it one thing about i think it's worth saying the email story is a big enough story that even the nonfox media is doing a good job not nbc the excuse that keeps being run on ms mbc you can't believe something that was posted on facebook a it is not a posting on facebook but usually when there is a false confession or a claim to a terror attack it has to come days later not as it's happening,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,sean there are more questions than answers in theterror attack in benghazi according to emails obtained by the fox newschannel the two former navy seals were killed 7 hours after the fighting at the consulate began so why since the state department admits they were watching the events unfold in real time did the administration not act sooner jennifer griffin was on america s newsroom explaining what actions were taken by our military watch this,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,that s a question that the president of the united states needs to answer to the american people jennifer s reporting was interesting combined with the state department briefing they provided on october 8 tlooks like the only reinforcements that arrived in benghazi were called in from benghazi the rest of the movement that occurred resulted in no reinforcements at benghazi whatever other movements occurred we know they were clearly insufficient because welost four americans we know at 5 00 p m on september 11 2012 president obama vice president bident andsecretary of defense were meeting in the oval office as you had these emails coming into the white house situation room explaining that our consulate was under attack we didn t know where the ambassador was people were wounded these emails were coming in while they were in the oval office so far everything we can tell points in the distribution of the president making no decision to rescue these people have you to explain to the american people whether or not that s the case,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,yeah i mean that gis is what we need to find out we need to know the president needs to answer the question what did you know when you went to bed that night did you go to bed while this attack was on ongoing in he needs to explain why he made the decision apparently not to send in reinfoursesments that were a little over 400 mile away that could have been there within hours you have a situation where we know for example from this same state department briefing on october 8 an a p reporter said to the state department official what was it about the attackers at the compound that led to you believe they were angry because of a video in and the state department official said we didn t believe that have you to ask somebody else but in days following we have seen the secretary of state the president the vice president the ambassador to the united nations saying this was because of a video there are very serious questions here,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,sean would that be fair as long as there was nobody on video that i mean we saw the trade centers get hit we saw the trade centers fall we saw america under attack on september 11 2001 why can't we get the videos,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121025_040000_Hannity,the president said they were releasing everything real time as we got t we know that wasn t the caiss each time more information comes out all it does is call further into question the actions of the president and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense calls into question what they were doing while this attack was underway the other issue at stake here that s what the ranking member of the intel committee brought up this morning in morning on fox we have somebody in cust dee in tunisia responsible for part of this attack we as a nation have no way to ask him any questions or detain him because we don t have a detention or interrogationpolicy,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121115_020000_Hannity,number 1 i can't believe the president said that we sent someone out to explain benghazi who had nothing to do with benghazi that s pretty stunning why did they pick her if she had nothing to do with benghazi she is not in charge of conflict security she works in the u n why nobody from the state department i believe she s a close political ally of the president she went on national tv four or five days after the attack when there is no credible informs that the video scenario was real and she either through incompetence or an intentional effort to mislead the american people tried to spin a story that would help the president because if it was true that this was an al qaeda attack long time in the making that killed our ambassador and three other brave americans so much for the story we killed osama bin laden al qaeda s on the run being dismantled i am going to hold her accountable she volunteered she is either very incompetent or she was misleading but the person i brame blame the most is president,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121115_020000_Hannity,well i tell you everything you said about general petraeus is true we were losing in iraq he turned it around he got us back on good footing in afghanistan that i think the president has made poor decisions on iraq and afghanistan in spite of great military leadership but general petraeus supposedly told the house intelligence and senate intelligence committee a couple of days after the attack he thought it was the result of a radio he needs to testify secretary clinton needs to testify august 15 ambassador stevens sent a cable from libya to the state department to secretary clinton saying we have identified 10 militia groups associated with al qaeda in benghazi they are all over the place if there is a coordinated attack we can't defend the consulate so she needs to account for why she did not grant the security request we need to hear from all of these people the way the congress is doing it they are going to fall through the cracks,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,reporter that s what we're hearing on the ground here anderson the attack that took place the second attack was a much more intense attack than what was initially seen at the consulate although much shorter in duration some of the military officials we're talking to here were saying that they were using rocket propelled grenades one was even saying that they were using mortar fire and that the rounds impacted pretty much immediately and for anyone who knows how mortar calibration works it's pretty rare that you would be able to hit your target the first time you do try to attempt to hit it with a mortar but we are hearing here that the second attack most certainly was more intense and involved more fire power than the first time around and that is why libyan government officials are saying that they believe that this was a pre planned strike perhaps not necessarily to be timed with september 11th but that most certainly the extremists that carried out this assault had planned it perhaps they shelved the plans and then had seen a target of opportunity to strike and strike they did as we now know,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well earlier in the day we had this massive pro democracy demonstration that did in fact take place and following that at around 10 00 at night hundreds of these individuals went to the headquarters of a known militant extremist group here and remember the libyan government says that it has detained some individuals from that organization in association with this attack it was in fact the attack on the consulate that really was the catalyst for these demonstrations but then the catalyst for these individuals to go out and try to retake the compound and they were saying retake the city from the hands of the extremists and at the compound itself was really quite the sense of euphoria people saying that they were the ones that began this revolution in benghazi that they were going to be the ones who were going to take their city back they were actually apologizing to america saying that this is the real libya the libyans who are going out trying to regain control oftheir own cities trying to implement the democracy that they fought so hard for but then things took a very sinister turn because the second location that they struck in fact ended up being the headquarters of a battalion that has been legitimized by the government the government took to the air waves trying to convince these individuals to back off that and other various compounds saying it was gadhafi loyalists trying to capitalize on the euphoria of the crowd to try to move them towards these other units that were in fact under the control of the government that were in fact loyal to the government in and of itself we were at one of these locations some pretty intense gunfire we're hearing that over a dozen people were wounded and it just goes to underscore how chaotic and how volatile the situation here really is and of course how easily manipulated,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,yes anderson i would expect that we will hear from the president on this when he addresses the u n general assembly next week both about the specifics of the attack in libya and the unrest in the middle east more broadly they don t have a lot to gain to be just crassly political about it from talking to talking too much about it until they have more facts because he is going to the u n next week he will have the big world stage so it's a natural opportunity for him to address it look for it there,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,fareed we did see some dip in poll numbers on foreign policy in the wake of this do you think do these attacks hurt the president in terms of foreign policy,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well i had a chance to talk to a senior romney advisor about this he said about the benghazi attack and the administration s response to it that they would like to see what he called more clarity from the administration when it comes to what exactly happened what led up to the deaths of those american diplomats in libya but i think the campaign also acknowledges anderson that they ve had a rough couple of weeks starting with that initial statement on what happened in libya and egypt mitt romney clearly spoke before all of the facts came in and then as you saw what happened this week with his hidden camera video leaked to mother jones they were put on the defensive over economic issues,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,jessica we did see ambassador susan rice at the u n saying that i mean indicating not really talking about this in terms of being a terrorist attack it was days later the terrorist attack part of this was really discussed is there concern in the obama campaign this controversy might be providing republicans some fodder to put a chink in the president s foreign policyarmor,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well not yet not given romney s response so far which was not handled well anderson but the larger potential here is that if there is another attack on americans in another country or in libya if this grows in some way that s the real danger for the president because his strength in foreign policy is really about the perception that he is a decisive and clear leader and that s what voters it's perceived that voters are responding to if world events seem to be spinning out of his control then that leadership quality could erode for him but we're not at that stage yet and so the campaign is not reflecting any kind of anxiety on that front at this moment,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,he could see that bad news was hurting the president he didn t need to do very much to pile on i think that in this case because romney has been inept it hasn t really translated much i agree with jessica if something else were to happen it might change that but obama again if he gets out ahead of it because really these have not been events where people feel as though the united states is under attack under siege there s a feeling that something is spinning out of control inthe middle east and we need to understand it,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the thing that keeps me up at night probably more than most is the fear of an attack probably because i lived through one and had to be responsible for a city during the worst attack in the history,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,very hard to tell people in america not to be worried about terrorism i wish i could say that to him you shouldn t worry about it because the reality is that we are at risk of having a terrorist attack in the united states not just a day of september 11th i watched people before the buildings came down i watched people dying from debris that fell from the building and hit and crushedthem i was trapped in a building myself for 20 minutes 25 minutes so sure i can relate to the fear and it's a real fear the thing that keeps me up at night the most is the whole idea of the use of nuclear material and the use of what i would call extraordinary biological weapons chemical and biological weapons where we don t have the capacity yet to deal quite with that with that form of attack i remember exactly the date the night of september 14 2001 president bush had come to new york that day,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120922_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,9 00 i set up a secret meeting at gracie mansion with my medical task force brought in the law enforcement people and brought in all of the experts that i could find on biological weapons they started telling me about the danger of smallpox and the choices i would have to make if there was a smallpox attack on new york city and the choice basically came down to putting people on randall s island and letting them die and then surrounding randall s island with troops so they couldn t get off randall s island and spread smallpox to other people god forbid we had to face thesechoices oh say does that star spangled banner,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120929_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,i say that she was being briefed all the time and if she wasn t being briefed if she was declining her intelligence briefing which has been reported on fox then she is at fault for that too they had warning after warning yesterday s wall street journal makes it extremely clear how much warning they had various aassassination attempts destruction ofproperty attempts reports from various intelligence sources they did nothing to protect the ambassador whatsoever that s wrong plus there was the coverup afterwards immediately afterwards when it was clear that well armed well organized terrorists had done this attack the state department and ms rice at the u n werestill saying and mr obama were still saying it was spontaneous uprising eventhough the killers had automatic antiaircraft cannon in which they were raking the building that s not the kind of thing a person usually carries in his pocket,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120929_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill possible that she said it on her own it's not unheard of that a u n ambassador would do that most likely somebody said look you have got to get out there and say x and y hillary clinton is a very shrewd politician she didn t say anything inadvertently one way or the other about the attack i agree with you that the american intelligence agencies had to know it was hot over there in benghazi certainly we could have done a better job protecting our people im not sure that hillary clinton was directly responsible for all of that im saying that because of so much else on her plate she is racing around in china got iran got israel got all of that kind of stuff i know i manage a very small operation compared to her and i don t know what everybody is doing somebody might come across and say look this segment may be going down or this person is not doing it and it kind of goes right off my head so i don t know if beshould be that tough on mrs clinton do you think go ahead,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121129_090000_Anderson_Cooper_360,no i don t think so i mean the administration got itself into trouble particularly ambassador rice got herself in unnecessary trouble just being so assertive on television and denying the possibility that you had an organized terrorist attack in benghazi i think if ambassador rice and others in the administration had been a little less determined to say that this well known video was behind it all i think this problem would have never happened,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121129_090000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i don t really think so i think ambassador rice could have easily said that we may have had an organized terrorist group that may have been affiliated with al qaeda behind the attack in benghazi i don t think it would have been compromising of any sensitive information i think the administration has used that as an excuse and really you know america has a lot of overclassification there s no doubt about it but that s one reason you know we have adults and they're supposed to be able to handle this i don t think it would have been difficult for her to give a more nuanced discussion of what transpired in bengahzi,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120918_040000_Hannity,indeed we are learning more today as it goes on about the attack on the U.S. embassy in benches gazy and libya originally the administration said it was part of the original protest but now it looks like it may not be the case 9 35 in the evening the attacks began it turns out there were no protests going on at all and as it turns out we are also learning the libyan president may be correct in how it went down it happened in 9 11 also the fact that he says they were able to attack a safe house in addition to the compound building and in addition he points to the fact there was a level of coordination between the attackers and this was a sustained militant operation not simply a protest that got out of control in beirut they took to the street and demanded more protests as a result of this anti muslim movie that came out this entire crowd chanting back death to america today i sat down with the organizer of the protester here in cairo he s the brother of the leader of al qaeda what is so amazing he said he hasn t even watched it let alone knowing all the things that are in it it's the extremists in lebanon which is a very explosive combination back to you,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120918_040000_Hannity,absolutely nothing and i think that s evident to people sean i did did a poll last week and it has alarming news you have me taking the optimist in this situation and i am and i am still confident we are going to win but my sample which before the example had romney 7 ahead now has obama 3 ahead and the two things that are driving it more than anything else are first a shift toward a democratic party identification used to be 34 democrats 31 republican now it's 38 to 28 secondly single women married women are voting for romney by 55 to 40 but single women are voting for obama by 60 to 32 and 45 for single white women and married white women and 45 of all white women are single so these are huge obstacles i couldn t understand during the democratic convention why they were constantly pushing the party brand not obama and not attacking romney but equal pay and abortion and contraception and all that stuff and the answer is because they have really scored big with white single women,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120918_040000_Hannity,yeah the president of libya is speaking more truthfully than the united states government on this at the moment he says what happened in benghazi is a premedicated attack it has nothing to do with the video and there s always a video there s always a cartoons there s always a teddy bear there s always some prenext for the mob to go crazy what is important is for free nations to say we around going to get into that game with you and it's absolutely disgraceful the sight you showed the people taking them in for questioning,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120918_040000_Hannity,the best assessment we have today is in fact it was not a premeditated attack what happened initially it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just happened in cairo as a consequence of the video our current assessment is what happened in benghazi was a spontaneous reaction to what happened hours before in cairo almost a copycat against our facility in cairo which were prompted of course by the video what our assessment is of the present is in fact it began spontaneously in benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in cairo,0

real change and tonight just outside cincinnati the romney campaign attempting to underscore that message by holding a big mega rally in westchester ohio featuring nearly 100 governors senators keng men and other republican luminaries to talk about the real change you would get if you elect mitt romney so who did he enlist to sell this message of what real change he s offering america the headliners were george w bush s secretary of state george w bush s labor secretary the governor and current speaker of the house mitt romney change you can believe in if you really liked george w bush and if you like the current republican congress then we're the kind of real change we're looking for who cast this thing the democrats one of the reasons that the message of real change resonated back in 2008 because the country at large had ceased to be delighted by the george w bush administration and it wasn t just the war in iraq or or or or it was stuff like this this is the U.S. state department s annual report on global terrorism in 2003 every year they would put together a report like this detailing accidents of terrorism around the world and the next report after this one showed that despite the bush administration s claims that we were winning the war on terror despite the constant claims the number of terrorist attacks had gone up to its highest level in the two decades the state department had been publishing this report what was the bush administration s solution to that problem the solution was to stop publishing the report the bush administration just eliminated that annual report once it included something very politically inconvenient the bush administration had a habit of doing this if you don t like the data get rid of the data earlier they were face wd a new report from their own education department showing that charter school kids were falling behind public school kids how do you deal with your own administration s data on underperforming charter schools you cut back on the data that you collect about charter schools the bush administration just announced they would be collecting less data going forward in 2003 after the bush administration labor department report detailed mass layoffs in the manufacturing sector the bush administration announced they were going to stop publishing information about mass layoffs if we get rid of the data pointing to a problem maybe the data wouldn t look so bad the obvious move is to get rid of it this was a hall mark of the george w bush administration and it appears to be one of the things that mr romney liked very much about the george w bush administration it at least appears to be one of the things that he s promising to bring back you don t like the data presented kill the report after the totally unimpeachable ly did a report concluded that romney s plan would be great for rich people and hurt everybody else the response to that was to go guns blazing against the center you don t like the message shoot the messenger last month after the bureau of labor statistics announced the unemployment rate was going down the right started attacking the bureau of labor statistics as if they were the problem because they said the unemployment rate was going down it used to be that democrats and republicans would argue about how best to deal with some factual things some problem facing the national now republicans do it differently they do it differently than everybody else this is not a mirror image problems on both sides they refuse to acknowledge factual thing they are still doing it was brought to a whole new level last week when it was revealed that a nonpartisan tax report was withdrawn by a federal agency because republicans protested its findings the federal agency in question here is the congressional resource service they're kind of the gold standard congress s internal think tank members of congress have a question about policy or issue they look into it for them and they issue a report in response to a member of congress asking for that report the congressional research service is as nonpa parpartisan gets in washington and a little more than a month ago they issued a report on tax policy they found there is no connection between lowering the tax rates on millionaires and billionaires and creating economic growth there s no evidence that if you cut taxes on the rich that that makes the economy grow that s a problem because that is essentially mitt romney s whole reason for living this is the republican party s economic reason for existing if you cut taxes on the rich the job creators that will jump start the economy this is the whole basis of the party economic philosophy this is why congressional republicans pledge their first born children to a man named grover and here comes this highly respected agency that says it turns out the whole thing is bunk giving rich people a tax break doesn t help the economy but it sure does help rich people what do you do if you re the republican party you pressure the agency into burying the report which sp exactly what republicans in congress did this fall the new york times is reporting that the congressional research service quietly withdrew their entire report reportedly against the advice of their own economics experts this is amazing right if a report tells you something you do not want to hear get rid of the report especially if that report is coming out on the eve of a big election and it debunks your candidate s whole economic argument luckily breaking news the report does still exist you can find it right now you can read it right now it's not written very long you can find it at nanoblog com and dls nothing that republicans can do to stop that we will see you again on sunday night,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121016_040000_Hannity,of course that s what harry truman said it does symptom with the president which she is not on the other hand the buck with respect to providing security is certainly within her area of responsibility and it was a failure on the other hand the responsibility for the way the white house has tried to cover thisp to manage it in a way that suggested that at first it was a youtube that it was not anything to do with1 not anything to do with a planned attack with heavy weapons ithink the responsibility for that as well as the responsibility for the secretary of state not providing appropriate security does in fact fall to the president,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121016_040000_Hannity,sean well i would agree with that but this does not make this go away by any stretch of the imagination the requests for security denied on the anniversary of 9 11 banghazi a hotbed for terrorist training we already know that also this is the problem they have with their story it's falling apart because they said that this was spontaneous a mob uprising but we had somebody at the state department watching in real time our intelligence knew in less than 24 hours that this was a terror attack but five days later they sent out you know secretary or ambassador ricewas out there jay carney was out there the president was out there even hillary clinton saying this was related to this video that is not true they knew it wasn t true they had to know it wasn t true,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121016_040000_Hannity,sean is it conceivable you ve worked in many white houses is it even conceivable that the intelligence committee knewwithin 24 hours that this was a terror attack that intelligence community and the state department knew that this was not spontaneous not a mob action not related to the movie is it in any conceivable that the white house up to five days later and then when the president repeated it on the view what seven days later and then went to the u n was blaming the movie was it possible the white house did notknow and did not know immediately,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121016_040000_Hannity,it does and i must say i was white house chief of staff to president gerald ford and i was in every meeting in the white house and on national security matters sat in on the national security council i don t remember president ford ever once even allowing somebody to raise a political issue with respect to a national security matter i think the fact that the president went off to las vegas or wherever he was in nevada suggests that that was his priority he obviously was dismissive of the fact that four americans had been killed and we ve seen what obviously was a terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121020_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,it is important because the iraq war brought divisions within the u n and the world that we hadn t seen for a long time and as i said at the beginning of the war that when a country s attacked it has a right to defend itself but when it's a broader question of security for all of us you cannot do without the security the legitimacy of the security council in this case the war was the war took place without theconsent of the security council and we did not find the weapons of mass destruction which ostensibly we went there for and the u n inspectors were not given the time to do their work,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121117_100000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,the first thing chairman rogers and i decided not to subject ourselves to the media until we came back into session because our job is to follow the facts and find out what occurred we oversee the intelligence community and we deal with issues of national security so that s clearly where our focus was as far as that is concerned what the general basically said at that time is that there was a terrorist situation and that there were people outside and if you look at the tapes and if you look at the information it was a chaotic type of situation we had looters who came in and we had people with weapons running around and there didn t seem to be any command and control but that changed three hours later when they went to the annex you had a sophisticated operation of terrorists who knew how to operate weaponry and made direct hits and that seemed to be clearly a terrorist attack now the issue is the films and you can see the two situations occurring especially the one the first attack where it seemed to be chaotic and they were attacking our consulate,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121117_100000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well we ll take any measures necessary to stop the aggression against the civilians and we're taking immense precautions not to hurt palestinian civilians our planes have carried out hundreds of attacks and the number of palestinian civilians and have been very very small we regret any loss of civilian life but we're fighting an enemy keep in mind pierce we're fighting an enemy that is hiding behind its own civilian population while trying to kill a maximum number of civilian israelis and it's between a terrorist organization and it is trying to minimize the number of civilians who are hurt we make tens of thousands of phone calls that might be hit giving them ample warning to leave their homes we send them text messages and leaflet their areas and they exercise caution and one thing i know that it aborted a bombing run along the long range rocket because he saw children running around that rocket and that area and one of the rockets later hit outside of tel aviv it is the price we pay for what we do,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121117_100000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,it's the doves who empower the hawks and i ll give you an example of it in 2005 israel conducted an experiment and they spoke to gaza and they said this is a model and we will leave to gaza and then we will leave the west bank and then the question is what happens if the gas is used to fire missiles and the whole international community says they expect you to fight back and israel in h to do that and then came the goldstone report and put out by the quote doves how did we leave the west bank because if we leave the west bank and hamas takes over and we try to defend our people people like nick and others will attack us and therefore it's been very very hard to make peace because of the way israel is condemned i support the obama administration s view defending israel s right to defend its people by proportional means and it's important for the international community to support that if you want to see israel eventually leave the west bank that s the only way israel can leave the west bank if it knows it will have support if it has to defend itself against rocket attacks,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121117_100000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well first of all i think we have to accept that we're not going to kill our way to a solution here that in fact in many cases the use of military force is counterproductive however there have been some recent advances in terms of our technology such that systems such as iron dome have made it more capable a more capable israel in terms of defending against these rocket attack but if you believe that the military is going to be a solution to these problems i think we have another thing coming,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121026_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,this is new today that he during the 60 minutes interview the part that was never aired it never aired he did say that it was a terror attack but then he changed his story the question for me tonight is why did the story change from the president,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121026_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,no no others are undercovering this story take for example that sound bite with all due respect to the president that sound bite is just simply not true demonstrably not true because now we have the emails directly going to the white house to the state department to the pentagon telling them that the attack was underway that there were 20 people on the compound with guns that the ambassador had locked himself in this safe house and this attack would go on for seven hours and also that this group this islamist jihadist group al sharia was claiming responsibilities for the attack,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121026_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,preplanned terrorist attack or whether it was about a spontaneous protest over a video we were told b very little was said about a and it turns out the more information we get the more it appears all about a,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121026_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,the early information is that the cia chief in libya was reporting this was a terrorist attack that they knew they came out for weeks bill and said it was not premeditated it was spontaneous it was spontaneous not preplanned attack now we see in those cables 20 guys show up in the compound with guns left off mortars at the cia annex that s when the other two guys died fire bombing ambassador is in a safe room for his life waiting for backup none would come he was asphyxiated by all the smoke that came in there while he was waiting for the backup that did not come they know all of this did they want us to believe that the it wasn t preplanned like the 20 guys just randomly walked by the consulate while they are out for the evening stroll let s go attack the consulate you are going to disclose some disclose all,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121026_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,many people are thinking they are going to try to blame that on president obama too terrorist attack it's unfortunate and there is a question about whether we were adequately protected over there and should have been more protected,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121002_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,impact segment tonight anti obama forces around the country are hoping thatallegations of a coverup in libya involving the assassination of the americanambassador there will hurt the president s re election chances first the time line on september 11th U.S. ambassador to libya chris stevens was assassinated in benghazi on september 129 president obama condemned the attack and then flew though las vegas for a campaign event on september 126th U.S. ambassador to the united nations susan rice called the assassination a spontaneous attack but the same day a top libyan official said the assassination was preplanned on september 19th matthew olsen director of the president s counter terrorism unit confirmed that theassassination was indeed a terror attack why did it take 8 days to confirm that pat caddell is angry about it,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121002_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill you are joking but we have a call in to the governor and we asked very politely very respectfully look we have got about a month all right you need to give us a time frame here i think he is going to do it but your point is taken go here is the mistake he has gone small ball is he not going to win the election small ball with obama what do i mean about that he has the slogan of the week hit and run attacks instead of making more general arguments that the media which are not inclined to be nice to romney and inclined to ignore stories that are harmful to obama the media would then have to report give you a concrete example middle east policy around the world embassy aflame al qaeda flags hoisted over more embassies you have this whole thing clearly the obama policy so does romney seized opportunity no he a one off attack a correct attack i would say on the statement issued by the cairo embassy which was a grabbling apology he rans away with it what he should have done is to give a speech to make the argument that the grabbling argument from the cairo embassy was simply one example of the way that obama and the administration have treated the middle east as a way to say we're really nice to you if we try to sweet talk them out of their weapons if we refuse to support the revolution against the campaign lead from behind inthe area we are going to be liked and everything will be nice so the problem i have here is obama very vulnerable remember this is the one election where he is ahead on the issue of foreign affairs democrats are usually way behind why because usama bin laden is dead so a week before the eruption of this anti americanism the democrats spend a week in charlotte touting the bin laden raid and a way of saying you know we have now fixed the problem these demonstrations are a complete demolition and they are a a way to refute the whole idea that this has been an effective policy romney should have seize the opportunity,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i want to say we thecommittee were in possession of information that provided by the intelligence community that pretty much said this was a military style attack within less than 24 hours,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,presumably the white house also had that information so why then on september 15th did the united nations ambassador susan rice describe the attackthis way,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the spontaneous not premeditated is the important part that was four days after raw intelligence was availablecontradicting that three days after the intelligence community may have apprised both lawmakers and the white house that such intelligence preliminary though it may have been in fact existed so why then did susan rice say that an intelligence official tells us she was working off a set ofcia talking points several senior administration officials tell us ambassadorrice s use of the word spontaneous came directly from an assessment coming from congress and was not edited by the white house but keeping them honest the white house had been in frequent contact with the cia days before that and the cia reportedly had at least raw intelligence casting doubt on the idea this attack was spontaneous however the intelligence official who told us about the talking points says it took daysto reconcile contradictory information surrounding the attack so is this a case of thecia covering its backside or as many republicans allege the white house initially choosing a more politically palatable narrative to downplay terrorism fran townsend joins us shortly with her take and so does bob baer,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well today the new york times david kirkpatrick reports on a meeting he had with a keysuspect in the attack he reportedly means the group widely suspected in the benghazi assault that meeting took place not in a jail cell not in secret but on a hotel patio joining me david kirkpatrick bob baer on the phone fran townsend fran now serves on the cia external advisory committee and recently visited libya with her employer mcandrews and forbes fran every white house relies on information from the intelligence community getting the experts to help with what to say publicly you also say there are timeswhen mistakes happen but you say you don t think this is a mistake you think they knew more than they were publicly letting on,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,but we have news now that it was the cia station chief inlibya who compiled intelligence reports indicating these attacks were not spontaneous but were launched by militants and the station chief we're told sent that information to washington we don t know exactly who received it would that not be passed on would general petraeus at the cia keep that until he got a triple source second source,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well john what usually happens in a situation like this is the chief of station in a place like tripoli will be sending in what s called situation reports and as the crisis picks up or gets worse he ll be sending them in every hour as fran said they will be conflicting it will be raw information but apparently this happened in tripoli these things are sent back to langley and distributed around the united states government including the united nations tosusan rice to the white house there s not a chance that the cia would withhold this information from the white house or probably the united nations our office in the united nations either it's just the way it works it's a system it's almost mechanical it's hard to short circuit in addition the cia director would be calling the white house and videoconferences calling the national security council i have never seen an attack on the united states that was not immediately reported to the white house,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,several days after the attack what was that for sure it was strange that a few days after the attack ambassador rice still was talking about a peaceful protest when we journalists without the resources of the cia were able to find out from witnesses and embassy guards libyan guards it was absolutely no peacefulprotest but at the same time keep in mind that it's very hard to figure out who is and who is not a militant around here there s a lot of lot of people running around with guns and allkinds of ideologies and it is entirely possible to have a spontaneous attack that could be called terrorism and could also be called spontaneous so some of this debate feels a little bit like a false dichotomy when you re here on the ground in benghazi,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i want to turn to this remarkable story you broke today you actually sat down for two hours with one of the men who possibly could be a ringleader in the attacks on the U.S. mission the president says we will hunt this person down or these people down and find them was it hard to find him,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,no it was not his name was mentioned in our paper and in the wall street journal earlier this week and when a libyan intermediary called him on our behalf he was eager to talk and set up a meeting so he met us at a hotel he walked by a bunch of other journalists who didn t recognize him and we all sat together on the patio you re right he is at the very least a key witness he acknowledged being on the scene even if he didn t say he participated in the attacks many witnesses have described him as one of the people commanding fighters inside the attack and it's puzzling to seehow much at large and at ease he is around benghazi,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,bob baer does it surprise you so long after these attacks that a reporter can sit down sipping a drink in ahotel having a conversation with this man and no one from either the libyan government orthe united states government has talked to him,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well it does surprise me in the sense i had no idea that libya was such in a chaotic situation where there s absolutely no central authority this man should have been brought in within the first 24 hours interviewed either found guilty or innocent let go or whatever but the fact that journalists can get to him first tells me the situation is fairly hopeless there that we will ever get to the bottom of the murder of the ambassador and the attack on our consulate there it is truly truly chaotic there and it's absolutely rightthat it's the militias that run the country and we don t know what their ideology is it could have been multiple militias that attacked the U.S. consulate there we just may not know for years,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,now for how this is playing out politically paul begala and ari fleischer so paul the attack on the benghazi consulate was a big flash point in the last debate i know you think it's time for these guys to move on afghanistan for example but given the expanded congressional investigations the lot of questions about the administration s handling how much benghazi do you think will be in the next debate,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i do think it's a certainty it is i will say an important issue to investigate the administration s investigating congress is investigating that s good that s professionals doing their job they happen to be professional politicians too but that is the job of the congress of the united states and also the pickering investigation that the administration has sponsored the hard thing for both of these guys is i think they made important mistakes on this issue the administration clearly did not have all the facts when they started saying that they had all the facts so the initial stories they say were overtaken by events that s a problem governor romney on the other hand also didn t have all the facts and he issued a statement right when the attacks were happening that struck a lot of people even republicans as very very political so both of these guys have a vulnerability on it they will each try to exploit it it's certain to come up but frankly there s tens of thousands of americans still in harm s way fighting the longest war of american history and i hope we have a thorough discussion about afghanistan because that actually i think the real flash point and maybe the biggest divide between thetwo candidates,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well it's not to get advantage out of benghazi john but the fact of the matter is benghazi was the first successful terrorist attack on our country since september 11th 2001 and we as a country have an obligation to figure out how and why it happened after all our embassies and our consulates around the world are built like forts they're built like forts because we know they're targets how in the case of benghazi was america struck there were security failures there were blunders made who why how all of this is vital to making sure we learn so it doesn t happen again now in the handling of it and the explanation for it this administration was terribly ham handed it really looked to me as if for political reasons they did not want to indicate that america had been struck by terrorism they wanted to downplay it they wanted to attribute it to a youtube video that way politically the president could continue to score points off of hissuccessful killing of bin laden and the suggestion he s kept us safe from terrorism so it's a serious legitimate governing issue it ought to come up it's part of what commander in chiefs do to keep us safe,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120929_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i agree with this jennifer granholm when i watched the convention speeches for the democratic convention i thought that bill clinton made a mesmerizing speech brilliant both in the rhetoric and the devil of the detail which was undeniable all the fact checkers attacked him the next day and didn t find anything to attack him over you then have barack obama the next night and i just didn t think it was nearly as good i thought that was a bit of a problem even though the clinton effect can help him the barack obama now has not got that sort of messianic feel he had four years ago he s got to really raise his game in these debates,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120929_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,the great thing about this debate is that it gives him the chance to directly confronmitt romney on what his plans are mitt romney has been talking generally about how he s going to save the country from the economic mess that the president has led us into well the reality is the stock market is booming we ve seen the jobs numbers turn around the numbers today saying that there s net job creation takes away a big talking point and what is mitt romney going to do specifically how is his tax plan going to be structured he hasn t answered those what deductions is he going to take away because failure to answer allows for there to be an argument that he s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy so i think the president has a real opportunity here i do think in the convention bill clinton was a wonderful third party validater the president has a chance to go on the attack as well in a presidential way but i think again because the media is not going to allow for the president to walk out of there as a win because it will say that the race is essentially over i think the media will end up declaring mitt romney the winner regardless,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121114_090000_The_OReilly_Factor,well i think it can and i think romney did not make the argument when you remember i think the reason he shied away from the argumentment basically to boil it counselthe givers and the takers to make it rather crudely he got caught with a tape saying the 47 now that number is not an accurate number that number describes people who don t pay income tax some of them are older people on social security or the military he he was open to attack and then he just ran away from that whereas i think ryan made the case it's a much smaller number but it's a significant number and the strategy of liberals has always been to increase dependency because that increases their constituencies and then keeps them in power i will give you one example of what s coming up obama care obama care will now subsidize insurance for families making up to four times the poverty rate that s 91 000 for family in some states now once you are subsidizing people at 91 000 you are subsidizing everyone that s the point that liberals want to do the more you make more people dependent the more you have your constituencies the more they reelect you and that s the strategy i don t think the argument is lost but i think it's got to be made and romney simply a couldn t really engage it very well particularly after his mistake and second he didn t feel fluent in it the way the younger generation the ryans and the jindals and the others who are up and coming and will be in 2016 the way that they can make it,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,there was a snarky tone the kind of professor accusation but also with all that we ve got going on the war and the economy the environment to begin with this silly attack on the fact that she once said she was of native american ancestry dishonest statement by him a lie that she used it to get ahead which has been refuted and later talk an the fact she s a very highly paid professor look you outlined it the issues run very much against him a key moment came when elizabeth warren talked about inhofe whoscott brown would like to make chairman on the committee says global warming is a hoax and would dismantle the epa said you re not running against jim inhofe you re running against me that s not true elizabeth warren is running against scott brown who wants to make jim inhofe the chairman of the environment committee jim demint an extreme right winger chairman of the committee that deals with health and communications he s not running for class president he s running for united states senator and by the way you re right that you couldn t get him to say the word romney with a subpoena he talks about support for some of obama s policies but he would vote to make mitch mcconnell the majority he talked about being bipartisan here s the deal with the democrats in the senate he s had a chance to be bipartisan because harry reid and the democratic leadership have brought up things in conjunction with the administration but we see what goes on in the house if mitch mcconnell becomes the majority leader it won t make any difference if scott brown would have voted for equal pay or would have voted for this because he ll get no opportunity to do it mitch mcconnell has said his first term goal was so defeat obama his next term goal would be to frustrate him that s why senator brown did not want to talk about issues except for his vehement objectio raising the taxes on the richest people in the country other than that i was disappointed by a snarky personal attack not consistent with the nice guy image he s put forward,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know on the issue of specifically attacking elizabeth warren on her native american heritage scott brown is saying look at her you can tell she s not native american look at her look at her he was saying that over and over again tonight i ve heard this attack from him i ve never seen him do that i actually i feel like it's racially offensive to say i can tell you re not native american look at you,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,the point is that he s clearly he s not doing as well in the polls as he thought they ve shown her somewhat ahead it's a little bit volatile here s his problem 60 of massachusetts or more are going to vote to make barackobama the second term president scott brown is committed to helping the people who will try to wreck that presidency he even sent an e mail boasting about how he would help barack obama so he s got to try to talk about all these other things he s angry he did not expect a year ago to be in a tough race for re election and it's in these personal attacks when he says she checked this box and checked that box that s simply not true by the way there s an analogy here the analogy is to the birth certificate of president obama let me see the record president obama showed the birth certificate and you still have republican officials in kansas saying oh well we're not sure about all this so it is a very similar effort to delegitimize your opponent rather than debate the issues when you think the issues go against you,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,first of all it's based on being graded on the curve you compare him to the extreme right wing republicans and he looks okay but he s not running against those republicans in fact he s running to help them by putting them into the majority and when you compare him to elizabeth warren or senator kennedy who he really inappropriately tried to claim was on his side on the question of birth control contraception no he s not there he used the arguments when he said oh i want it enforced but i don t want to help the plaintiffs lawyers that s the key if you start attacking the lawyers who are going to bring these lawsuits then you re saying the law shouldn t be enforced there is no federal agency able to do that kind of enforcement in a consistent basis if you re going to have anti discrimination laws enforced you re going to have to have people go to a lawyer and the lawyer accept it on a contingency basis these are not people with a lot of money while scott brown says he s for equal pay he demonizes the only effective enforcement method which is for people who have been wronged to have lawyers go to work for them,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120929_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well the answer to that question i think is not really clear so it's not unusual when you want to set up a security perimeter you may look to the host country if the host country is unable or unwilling to provide it we don t know what the answer to that is y may ask if you think you need it for U.S. military support but that s got to go through a process it needs state department and nsc support the U.S. military would have to make an assessment about how big a security package that would entail and lastly and perhaps most importantly you need host government the libyan government in this case support to allow U.S. military boots on the ground to provide sort of the defensive security perimeter around the benghazi compound now i spoke to a senior administration official who said they have been having regular meetings twice daily secure video teleconferences on updates of the investigation there has been regular deputies committee meetings hosted by dennis mcdonough the deputy national security advisor and discussions regarding libyan support and cooperation my law enforcement source was quite clear it's not that the libyans haven t been cooperative there have been discussions that the libyans were concerned that they themselves couldn t provide the sort of comprehensive security to protect the fbi team and that there were concerns on the libyan part about having a U.S. military presence on the ground all of that said anderson as you point out 18 days later after the attack the fbi today sort of indicated to me through a senior law enforcement official they're having serious debates as to whether or not with the passage of so much time whether it makes sense to take the risk at all even if they could have gotten the kind of support early on now what will they gain by going to benghazi and taking the security risk they may decide not to go at all,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120915_090000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,reporter we walked into the main residence building and that is where we were told ambassador stevens died of smoke inhalation standing inside that location seeing a partial bloodstains on the wall seeing the soot the ash the debris seeing remnants of the life that was and bits and pieces of what those two were actually stationed there believed in there there was a piece of paper that had scrawled across it libya is so important it was a real chilling somber experience to be walking through it and one also though must point out at this stage that the attack that took place did not just happen at this one location after personnel were evacuated from this compound they were then taken to a safe house where we are being told a short while later that location too coming under attack so this really is putting a lot of questions out there first and foremost of course the capabilities of the libyan government but also the questions to whether or not the U.S. underestimated the threat that it faces here libyan security officials have been telling us that for months now they ve been warning the united states about this growing extremist threat and that they have been growing ever more concerned about how little control they actually themselves have over the situation,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120915_090000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,given the circumstances in benghazi wolf probably not probably because there had been similar attacks on the british ambassador s convoy there had been an infiltration of islamic extremists from the southern part of libya there had been a series of attacks near the airport so there s no doubt that chris was well aware at the time that benghazi was less than a securecity,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120915_090000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,what do you think caused this attack was it simply that anti islamic film or is there something much bigger here that explains this hatred of the united states,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120915_090000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,sure frankly it's just a misguided notion i think a majority of the american voters will see it that way i guess they have to do something because they're so behind on the issue of foreign policy that i guess they feel they have to throw everything plus the kitchen sink to see if they can make a dent in president obama s leadership here and frankly it shows in the numbers he s ahead by what 8 to 10 points on foreign policy and i think frankly the blunder that mitt romney made earlier this week in attacking president obama on 9 11 with misguided facts i think underscores the fact that he is just not ready to be commander in chief and they're worried about that,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_040000_Hannity,it's interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack he went in the rose garden said this was an act of terrorism it was not a spontaneous demonstration is that what you re say something,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_040000_Hannity,this is the thing a lot of conservatives wanted mitt romney to take the lead on he didn t do well tonight he just there was a time line that case he could have made he didn t do it well and the president did refer to an act of terrorism on the day after attacks also administration then went on for days and days talking about this movie including aum the way up tothe president s appearance at un so romney did not make the case as well as he could have and i think that the viewer who s haven t followed it came away with a muddled impression,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_040000_Hannity,yes i agree with byron i think the fact that romney flubbed the initial answer or that he was corrected by the president then again by candy crowley this is a highly debatable point seems to get him off stride the problem i think bigger problem for the administration is that this is an issue that is now likely to dominate the debate just as did it coming out of the vice presidential debate that is something the white house and obama campaign cannot be happy b now we're back candy crowley as i understand walked back for correction of mitt romney and said on a broader point he was correct and the administration was blaming this on the video we're back into this discussion about the time line what happened when why administration was talking about the video not about a terrorist attack that is something that the white house can't be happyabout,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_030000_Anderson_Cooper_360,the solution is for them to understand we are permanent and legitimate and if we are attacked we ll retaliate hamas is not a partner for negotiation they are regarded as a terrorist organization right now the solution is to stop the fighting stop shooting at civilians to prevent the smuggling of advanced arms into gaza and create a situation where a terrorist on a regular basis can't open fire on civilians and disrupt their lives,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_030000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i don t think hamas will emerge strengthened not at all they had a large part of leadership has been eliminated many of their control centers arms factories taken a tremendous blow from the israeli defense forces conducted 1 500 attacks against hamas in the strip ten times more than the last confrontation in 2008 2009 we're willing to negotiate tonight even for a two state solution a palestinian state living side by side with peace security and mutual legitimacy with the state of israel and that would make president abbas i think a strong and prominent leader indeed,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_030000_Anderson_Cooper_360,again any time you are atta attacked the natural response is to rally around the flag and that s true in the united states it's true in gaza wherever so i i think it is true that if you held competitive election in gaza with a real alternative it's not clear hamas would win in this situation where people were under attack they i think hamas does come out stronger i think the only real way we can move out of the situation ambassador ambassador ambassador ambassadororan said broker a deal where hamas is moved by the egyptians at least until the next phase where fatah and hamas where there are parts of hamas that are considerably more moderate than the more extreme groups in gaza then you ve got a roughly unified israeli im sorry roughly unified palestinian negotiating party right now they will have to go through egypt,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121120_020000_Hannity,you don t have to be sherlock holmes to figure this out it's clear that the cia had the correct story its clear that the white house put out these people they were representing the white house the white house was calling the shots the white house was trying to cover up the fact that there was a attack on 9 11 if you doubt that look at what president obama said several times trying to claim that a youtube video was involved so the president himself was covering up what the cia was reporting,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120920_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think it is significant that the president s spokesperson would go on our networks and tell people thing that is are absolutely false and by the way fly in the face of the facts i think maybe the american people are owed an apology but the most important thing that we have to understand is that this video is not the cause of it islamists who use these videos use these toen flame people to attack america im confident that people are making videos right now we should be standing up for freedom of speech and that we will defend people s right to speak out and express their views rather than condemn the vehicle not the cause,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121121_020000_Hannity,cease fire what cease fire in fact if anything is taking place it's been an escalation today alone militants in gaza fired at least 130 rockets towards israel one of them landed in a tel aviv suburb it hit an apartment building but no serious injuries this was the farthest into israel also today there were sirens in jerusalem as it turns out a rocket there landed outside that city ironically landing in a palestinian village throughout the day there was barrage after barrage in southern israel i talked to one man a volunteer ambulance driver he returned home only to discover that his home had been hit by a rocket meanwhile israel during the last several hours has continued to pound gaza there have been reports of a massive fire in downtown gaza city there are reports that israeli military has hit a building that houses journalists and french news agency afp they say it houses the intelligence service of hamas in addition to the israeli air force the israeli navy is also launching attacks against gaza we have exclusive video that our fox news crew recorded today that shows israeli artillery on the outskirts of gaza firing into the strip israeli forces remain amassed along the border ready if necessary for a ground incurs lastly tucker the death toll on both sides continued to escalate at least 21 palestinians were killed two more israelis died in the conflict for the first time an israeli soldier is among them the soldier was killed by a mortar diplomacy continues but so too does the violence,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121121_020000_Hannity,i think it's very concerning although president obama publicly has been very supportive this past week of israel s right to defend itself i think there is a lot going on behind the scenes particularly efforts by the united states and others to persuade the netanyahu government not to go in with ground forces into the gaza strip because of the obvious ramifications having watched the efforts by the israeli military to destroy the rocket launching areas to find the longer range missiles that were supplied by iran i don t think they are nearly ready yet if the pressure on israel to agree to a cease fire is intense as it looks from the outside i think that a cease fire is agreed to in the next few days it's going to be very temporary what is really at issue here is a huge strategic shift this is not really hamas versus israel this is iran demonstrating they have the capability to attack israeli civilian population centers not just from iran not just from hezbollah and lebanon but clearly from hamas in the gaza strip as well,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_000000_The_OReilly_Factor,i think it's a big deal on its face with four americans dying and i think the thing is for the obama campaign is that they need to be careful how they talk about this when stefanie cutter the spokesperson is saying that this is not a foreign policy failure i know it's her job to say that but it feels like a dismissal of the problem and the president needs to be careful about how he talks about that i do think there is a sort of an institutional advantage for incumbent in this swalings he is the guy in the room with the briefers he has a sort of gravitas on that obama s case is he on the ipad with the briefers about security he has advantage when the american people learn more about this particular situation which is the most recent foreign policy situation that we're going tobe talking about the libya and benghazi stuff it is a problem for him because it gives people more information when you hear moreinformation you find out there was a distinct lack of security before the attack and a distinct lack of answers as to why after the attack i think that s a weakness,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_000000_The_OReilly_Factor,based on one phone call that information was based on one phone call reporters and it's been reported in every single outlet reporting on this that intelligence officials thoughtthat it was a planned attack from within 24 hours it was based on this one phone call that it was cherry picked that it might have been based on the video i do think there was an attempt to take it down that road and talk about the video for two to three weeks which the administration has to answer for here is the thing for mitt romney,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121005_030000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill it was a lot oftrouble for the president a cnn poll taken immediately after the debate said that 67 of registered voters believe mitt romney won the contest just 25 percent said president obama did a cbs news poll of uncommitted voters who watched the debate was interesting 46 of them say mitt romney won 22 believe the president came out on top 32 say it was a tie so it was a good night for governor romney indeed now what does this mean going forward number one the romney campaign is energized it will be easier to raise money number two the president s attack ads on television against romney not going to be taken as seriously because the folks have seen the governor definite himself effectively number three president obama will lose some steam in the polls and with the adoring media but and this is big mr obama will come back hard on october 16th you can count on that governor romney has to again be on his game two more things from the very beginning of the campaign i said the debates will tell the tale,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121005_030000_The_OReilly_Factor,and the point you brought up that substantive one where you said it was the best line romney had about you know he is the guy that wants to raise taxes on the middle class and reduce the taxes on the rich romney took the beginning of that debate and attacked each of the points and demolished them again all that came from negative advertising i think what he did last night is he dissolved 150 million of negative ads and turned them to dust,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121005_030000_The_OReilly_Factor,unfortunately you are wrong that s the tact that he has tried the guy is a good guy but he failed it didn t work that s the clint eastwood line his attack has to be what he did last night this is trickle down government the reason everything has gone wrong the debt is high the economy is struggling unemployment is high is because is he a trickle down government guy that s where he scored all his points if he keeps it up with a barrage of that from here to election day he wins,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120919_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,you know if romney had said what you had said instead of what he said he d be president i mean that is what you presented is the guts of his case which i think is a winning argument that obama is turning america into an entitlement state the problem is the actual words he used number one he said 47 to max the number of americans who aren t paying income tax and then he said these are people who consider themselves victims now that s not a very smart thing to say not even accurate and you tonight win an election by disparaging just about half of the electorate so simply as a matter of appealing to the electorate the way he put it was about the worst possible way i think the only way out of this is not to go over it line by line but is to pivot away p say look the heart of this is the question of entitlements and to go right after obama with an attack look at what he s done on welfare this was the one bipartisan success of the 1990s democratic president republican congress came together on up with of the great social successes of our time decreased the poverty rate of children addickcally reduced the welfare roles what does obama do the media announces the point that romney made that obama is completely wrong obama has in this regulation romney has to keep trying to make the point unafraid the essence of it is to young mine the legal underpinning of the fact that you must work to get welfare that s the core of the regulation the law was written so that nobody has the right to waive the requirement not a governor not the hhs which is how obama has now,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121019_040000_Hannity,my understanding it was a rather long lasting event the attack so it stands to reason they would call in for help going back to the susan rice testimony another thing that s curious about it's to kind of understate the word is why would she go out there and say things that apparently the state department itself didn t believe we had a state department official recently saying it wasn t our conclusion that it was a spontaneous protest that ran out of control you had a state department official saying they were monitoring it in real time how does susan rice get it in her head to say these other things dana if you re a high official in a re election campaign something like this happened somebody is going on every single sunday show wouldn t you community with that communicate with that person talk to her before,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121019_040000_Hannity,one of the biggest mistakes was not drawing a clear distinct line on the banghazi attacks to say only government officials to answer questions about this to protect the integrity by allowing other people to speak out they politicized,0

bloomberg senator schumer al and ann smith thank you for your invitation thank you for your extraordinarily warm welcome ann and i appreciate your friendship very very thank you applause now al you are rights a campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes blue jeans in the morning perhaps a suit for a lunch fundraiser sportcoat for dinner but it's no doubt nice to finally relax and wear to ann and i wear around the house laughter im glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition of course im pleased that the president is here we were chatting pleasantly this evening as if tuesday night never happened laughter and i credit that of course to the cardinal it's taken new york s highest spiritual authority to gets us back on our best behavior i was actually hoping the president would bring joe biden along this evening because he ll laugh at anything laughter of course this isn t a nice for serious politics and it was especially nice to see president obama and cardinal dolan sharing the dais despite their differences im sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president s wine turns into water or for that matter whether my water turns into wine laughter im pleased to once again have the chance to see governor cuomo who s already being talked about for higher office a very impressive fellow but he may be getting a little ahead of himself i mean let me get this straight the man has put in one term as a governor he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that s enough to run for president laughter of course we're down to the final month of the president s months of the president s term applause as president obama s surveys the waldorf banquet room with everyone in white tie and finery you have to wonder what he s thinking still a little time so much to redistribute laughter don t be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers he knows how to seize the moment this president and already has a compelling new campaign slogan you re better off now than you were four weeks ago you know with or without all the dignitaries that are here the al smith dinner surely lives up to its billing usually when i get invited to gatherings like this it's just to be the designated driver laughter your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the catholic church i have special admiration for the apostle saint peter to whom it is said upon this rock i will build my church the story s all the more inspiring when you consider that he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say if you got a church you didn t build that laughter of course with only 19 days to go until the finish line the campaign full of surprises the debates are very pint just the other night we had a very fun debate candy crowley and was happy to welcome but people were curious how we prepare for the debate let me tell you what i do first refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate laughter second find the biggest available straw man and mercily attack it big bird didn t even see it coming laughter by the way in the spirit of sesame street the president s remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter o and the number 16 trillion cheers and applause campaigns can be grueling exhausting president obama and i are each very lucky to have one person who s always in our corner someone who we can lean on and someone who s a comforting presence with whom we wouldn t be able to go another day i have my beautiful wife ann he has bill clinton laughter we got a big dose of the biden charm last week i ll tell you that in his debate with paul ryan im not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that joe intended because afterwards i heard from the federal election commission from now on whenever he appears on tv there s a recording of me afterwards that says im mitt romney and i i a prove this message rules have to be place because what other safeguards do we have besides the press applause i never suggest that the press is biased i recognize they have their job to do and i have my job to do my job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it applause let s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things when suddenly i pulled ahead in some of the major polls whatwas the headline polls show obama leading from behind laughter and i ve already seen early reports from tonight s dinner headline obama embraced by catholics romney dined with rich people laughter of course the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church there have been awkward popes liking when the president pulled pope benedict aside and shared advice how to deal with his critics he said look holy father whatever the problem is just blame it on pope john paul ii laughter of course the president has found a way to take the sting out of the obamacare mandates for the church for now on they ll be in latin we have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me he and i of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest it would be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty but fortunately we don t carry the burden of disliking one another our president has had fine and gracious moments don t tell anyone i said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud applause in our country you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will that s how it is for me there s more to life than politics at the al smith foundation the archdiocese of new york you show this in the work you do in causes that run deeper than allegiance than party or to any contest of the moment no matter which way the political winds are blowing what work goes on day and day out by this organization and you you answer with calm and willing hearts in service to the poor in care for the sick in defense inhts of conscience and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born you strive to bring god s love into every life applause i don t presume to have all your support e and on a night like this im certainly not going to ask for it but you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that i stand proudly with you as an ally and friend god bless you all and god bless the united states of america thank you cheers and applause,0

laughter thank you to al and nan to your eminence governor mrs romney governor cuomo mayor bloomberg senator schumer all the distinguished guests who are here in less than three weeks voters in states like ohio virginia and florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question what are we doing here laughter of course new yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years tonight i am here with a man whose father was a popular governor and who knows what it's like to run a major northeastern state and who could very well be president some day and im hoping it is andrew cuomo applause this is the third time that governor romney and i have met recently as some of you may have noticed i had a lot more energy in our second debate i was really well rested after the nice long debate i had in the first debate laughter applause although it turns out millions of americans focused in on the second debate who didn t focus in on the first debate and i happen to be one of them laughter i particularly want to apologize to chris matthews four years ago i gave him a thrill up his leg this time around i gave him a stroke laughter of course there s a lot of things i learned from that experience for example i learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift laughter take note gentleman now win or lose ing this is my last political campaign so im trying to drink it all in unfortunately mayor bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it laughter but that s okay im still making the most of my time in the city earlier today i went shopping at some stores in midtown i understand governor romney went shopping for some stores in midtown laughter it brought back some great memories because some of you know i went to school here in new york had a wonderful experience here applause used to love walking through central park loved to go to old yankee stadium the house that ruth built although he really did not build that laughter i hope everybody s aware of that applause it's been four years since i was last at the al smith dinner i have to admit some things have changed i ve heard people say barack you re not as young as you used to be you don t have the pep in your step and i say settle down joe im trying to run a cabinet meeting here he does smile when he says it though tomorrow it's back tocampaigning to cities and towns across our great country and i hear the same thing everywhere i go honestly we were hoping to see michelle laughter i have to admit it can be a grind sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever but paul ryan assured me we ve only been running for 2 hours and 50 something minutes applause of course the economy s on everybody s minds the unemployment rate is the lowest since i took office i don t have a joke here i just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is the lowest since i took office applause we're getting to that time when folks are making up their mind just the other day honey boo boo endorsed me that s a big relief laughter ultimately though tonight s not about the disagreements governor romney and i may have it's what we have in common can beginning with our unusual names actually mitt is his middle name i wish i could use my middle name laughter thinking ahead of our final debate on monday im hoping that governor romney watching at home is this voice monday s debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy spoiler alert we got bin laden laughter of course world affairs are a challenge for every candidate you know after some of you guys remember after my foreign trip in 2008 i was attacked as a celebrity because i was so popular with our allies overseas i have to say im impressed with how well governor romney has avoided that problem laughter just so everyone knows in our third debate we won t spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other we will also interrupt the moderator just to mix things up laughter finally let me say that i ve been doing some thinking and i ve decided that for our final debate im going to go back to the strategy i used to prepare for the first debate im just kidding im trying to make axelrod sweat a little bit get him a little nervous laughter in all seriousness i couldn t be more honored to be here this evening honored to be leaders of the private and public sectors and particularly the extraordinary work done by the catholic church you know it's written in scripture applause it's written in scripture that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope this country s fought through some very tough years together while we still have a lot of work ahead we ve come as far as we have mainly because the perseverance and character of ordinary americans it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season opposing candidates can share the same stage people from both parties can come together applause come together to support a worthy cause i particularly want to thank governor romney for joining me because i admire him very much as a family man and a loving father and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones applause we may have different political perspectives but i think in fact im certain that we share the hope that the next four years will reflect the same decency and same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening may we all in the words of al smith do our full duty as citizens god bless you god bless your families and may god bless the united states of america of america thank you very much applause,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120913_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well as you said anderson there is a huge amount of confusion still but it's very unlikely that protesters came armed with rocket and other incendiary materials this was a very well planned attack it appears to have happened in several stages one thing i think is important to note in addition to ambassador stevens who really died with his colleagues in the line of duty in the service of his country there were a certain number of libyans who were also killed in the attack defending the consulate some reports as many as ten so it's important to realize that libyans died in this attack defending the U.S. consulate it does really appear to be a very well coordinated attack and the head of al qaeda zawahiri had explicit ly called for revenge for the had called for revenge and members and hadcalled for that revenge in libya you can imagine if you re thinking about it from al qaeda s point of view from anextremist s point of view having this kind of thing happen in libya is exactly what you want because you want precisely an attack on the americans in libya a country that is supporting many americans and that americans have obviously helped so it makes a lot of sense that it was in fact a 9 11 coordinated al qaeda attack,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121005_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,okay but let me jump in there let me ask maria that why on earth would barack obama be in shock that mitt romney was attacking him given it's exactly what mitt romney did in the entire republican debate race particularly in florida against newt gingrich as he said earlier did he not watch those debates has he never seen mitt romney debate,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121005_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i think that is a very good question piers because you would think that in talking about the preparation you would take a look at all of the debates and actually the one with newt gingrich is the one that i think they needed to take a look at because that s where he eviscerated the speaker and he did it by telling the blatant lies that newt gingrich actually talked about the next day so he should have been prepared for those kinds of attacks he should not have looked surprised and he should have been much more deft at not just defending his own record and talking about where we have been and what he has done to shore up the middle class and what he will continue to do but he should have absolutely brought up the 47 his offshoring the fact that mitt romney does not want to come clean on his income taxes and i think that would have been a much different debate,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120920_040000_Hannity,what do you think the way the media attacked this became the narrative mitt romney came out early mitt romney saw the images of our flag being burned and al qaeda flag be being hung up and death to america i think every american should speak out when they see those images what do you think of that attack and he with fast forward and we have a few narrative it's about a tape that we now discovered oops there s not we don t have the whole tape we were told it was the whole tape and now we find out that s not true either i wonder what words were taken out that they maybe conveniently lost,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120920_040000_Hannity,the other thing we didn t to after the embassy attack s the president went out in the rose garden rightly to condemn the death of our ambassador and failed to mention the attack on the embassy the message went across the region to those across the world you can attack the embassy and burn the flag and the president won t condemn you,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,good evening breaking news tonight you re looking live at gaza city a city on the edge any hope of a quick cease fire between israel and hamas appears to have gone another day of deadly attacks from both sides president obama has dispatched secretary of state hillary clinton for closed door meetings she stood side by side with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu tonight,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well that s true but i hope people see hamas for what it is and that is using their own people as human shields putting these missiles and rockets in places right in the middle of residential areas in homes and mosques and parks you don t do this i mean this borders on being an international war crime now the problem is that hamas isn t a member of either of the organizations the geneva conventions or others that would hold this as a war crime so it's a very difficult situation our solidarity has to be with israel this is a point where israel has been under attack for a long period of time and nothing has solved it also during this period of time i think the importance of achieving a two state solution really cannot be underestimated there s going to be no more better partner than mahmoud abbas and i think to a great extent the inability to enable israel and the palestinians to come together perhaps this will provide that opportunity perhaps the secretary of state will play a very dominant role after all her husband came the closest of anybody to establishing a two state solution so she knows exactly where all of this stands and what might be able to solve what has been an historic and very difficult situation,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,if i could just ask you one question about benghazi senator the key unanswered question appears to be after everything we ve been through in the last few weeks is who it was that decided to remove from the intelligence report the fact that the attack was probably linked to an al qaeda group are we any nearer to knowing the answer to that question,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well we have a process in place to find that out and the senate intelligence committee has made very clear and i made it clear in the meeting that we want that whole process from a to z gone through and who made what changes from the initial analysis done by the cia we want to know who did what i believe that the white house only changed one thing and that was the word consulate to mission i do not believe that any part of the administration in the sense of the white house made any changes and we know when director petraeus came to the senate intelligence committee the day after the event and we happened to have a transcript of this that he gave us his view that this was in fact a terrorist attack but there was some reluctance of including one of the groups which was al qaeda this is sort of a loose thing with people kind of knitting together quite possibly from three different groups but it was an attack and there should be no doubt about that nonetheless susan rice has been pilloried because she did what was required of her which was to use those talking points so we really need to know and she is getting the blame for it and quite unfairly,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well it seems like about 120 were killed about 60 of them were known terrorists about 60 or less than that were unfortunately uninvolved but who is responsible for that every death of innocent people is regrettable we lost three of our people today but what s happening here hamas specifically targets only civilian population in israel we have hundreds of thousands of people and children which are traumatized by this incoming missiles for the last seven years which adds salt into injury that we gave we turned over hamas in its entirety to the palestinians five years ago and they used this land that we gave it's not land for peace they used it as a platform to continue and attack us the first crime is that they target civilian population in israel the second crime against humanity that they used their own population as human shields we have been going out of our way to be as accurate as we can but unfortunately wars are ugly there s no war without casualties but again i think it's very important to put the blame where it belongs and this is the hamas terror organization,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well the plo palestine liberation organization remains the representative of the palestinian people even when hamas formed the palestinian government after the elections of 2006 they acknowledged this fact that the plo will be in charge of conducting negotiations with israel in order to resolve the conflict so there s no question about who represents the palestinian people here we do have political differences this is not a secret but when it comes to confronting this israeli brutal attack against the gaza strip witnessing the deaths of innocent civilians 135 so far have been killed almost 1 000 wounded we have put aside all our differences and we do our best to protect our people,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,when you say israel started this that s a ridiculous statement because the reason they targeted that particular individual was that he had been leading hamas in a series of murderous attacks on israelis going back quite a consider able time why shouldn t they defend themselves by taking him out,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121121_050000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well that particular person whom you are talking about was also instrumental in concluding the idea that the release of the israeli soldier a year ago and he has been instrumental at working to calm the situation down in the gaza strip these are reports that were published in british newspapers and american newspapers and israeli newspapers this is not the issue the issue here is piers it's not the issue of a chicken or egg here i mean there is a situation in the gaza strip four years ago israel attacked the gaza strip we all remember that and they will probably do it again in four years you know in the future unless they are willing to deal with the root causes of this problem unfortunately we are going to find ourselves in the same situation again do you think that israel today is more secure than they used to be four years ago or ten years ago had israel concluded agreement with the plo in 1999 to establish a palestinian state and we have managed to end this conflict both israelis and palestinians would be much more secure today,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,we appreciate you being with us thank you the historical context of the national tragedy cannot be understated the last time a diplomat of this stature was assassinated was 1979 when the U.S. ambassador to afghanistan was killed in a gun battle the events of yesterday felt similar to the era of weakness that president jimmy carter presided over on a day when americans hoped to pause in remembrance of the victims of the 9 11 terror attacks they were instead greeted with the face of a new age of terrorists even worse greeted with a president unwilling or unable to confront them but the violence on september 11 2012 didn t start libya it began when radical islamists in egypt who were outrained over a U.S. made film that insults muhammad and burned the american flag and replaced it with one similar to that of al qaeda the white house issue aid staimentd apologizing to theradicals saying quote the embassy condemns misguided efforts to hurt the religious feelings of muslims the president is at a campaign stop in las vegas he is expected to speak on this topic,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,i want to begin tonight by just saying a few words about a tough day that we have had today you know we we lost four americans last night who were killed when they were attacked at a diplomatic post in libya and they were serving overseas on our behalf despite the dangers despite the risks to help one of the world s youngest democracies got on its feet they were working to advance the interest and the values that we hold dear as americans and as americans we stand united all of us in gratitude for their service and we are mindful of their sacrifice and we want to send out heart felt prayers to their loved ones who grieve today cheering,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,obviously the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in egypt instead of condemning their actions it is never too early for the united states government to condemn attacks on americans and to defend our values the white house distanced itself last night from the statement saying it wasn t cleared by washington that reflects the mixed signals they're sending to the world,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,sean the interesting thing is that the president earlier said that mitt romney was quote willing to shoot first and aim second apparently now he is following governor romney ann coulter is here with her observations of what has gone on here look the president you know barack the appeaseer i mean this is remarkable to me that here we have our embassy that is breached and attacked by radical islamists they rip down our flag and our government s response for response officially for 9 1 2 hours is an apology,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,no i know i know it is back to the carter era and as reagan said strength never goes out of style they were testing us with the initial attacks and what did they get back from the obama administration a complaint about about some this protectual film that insulted the little darlings feelings,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120913_040000_Hannity,sean all the apologizing to the arab world there is an unwillingness to acknowledge the truth which radical islamists exist and they have no problem raiding our embassy here s the irony of all of this the liberal media and we will show this later what is their answer to attack governor romney for doing what our president should have done and say this is unacceptable we are not going to allow it we have a tape where they coordinated their questions together so they you ask you felr follow up you ask you follow up,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120926_010000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,good evening thank you ooers the newest data on the state of the election in two of the swingiest of the swing states ohio and florida new data out today the washington post putting out new numbers showing president obama ahead by eight points in iowa and four points in florida while the swing state map is what everybody is watching the swing states are the mostimportant to keep an eye on because that s where you wrap up the votes that allow you to win the election there s new national polling now for what it's worth there s new polling every day the republican leaning poll is out with their new national numbers today their national tracking poll putting president obama up byone point nationally the gallup tracking poll putting president obama up by three points today nationally that s in big picture perspective of what s going on in the presidential race for an even bigger picture perspective on those national numbers i should point out to you that of the last 20 national presidential polls of the 20national polls taken in the month of september every single one of those it 20 polls shows president obama winning nationally the range varies from one point up to eight points in some other polls but 20 straight national polls showing president obama ahead that s what you call a trend now whether or not that trend is depressing to republicans or whether it fires them up to try to do better for their candidate honestly the wisdom is that one of the most consequential things that can happen because of polling likethrks one of the the things that polling can cause is that it can have a fatal affect on fundraising it's interesting politico com had a big picture review of the romney campaign struggl struggles it included this piece ever since they published it quote to get a flavor of the challenge before them one top donor said that after mitt romney spoke at a fundraising breakfast on friday a will mitt win poll was taken at a table of ten men who paid to attend that fundraiser so at their table of ten men they asked each other will mitt win of the ten men not a single man said yes of ten active mitt romney supporters who were actively supporting him at that moment with their money zero said he will win and they admit to that at the fundraiser that s not a phenomenon that can last a super long time you don t get to sit around at 2500 a plate fundraisers talking about how your guy is going to lose eventually you re going to stop going to those fundraisers you will stop throwing good money after bad luckily for the romney campaign there is a solution to this potential problem that can be caused by polling this potential fundraising campaign death spiral there s a way around it a new argument emerged about thepolling that says that mitt romney is losing the race and losing badly in the new polls yes but the new argument on the right is that the polls are all wrong mathematically even the fox news poll they are all unfairly skewed to make it look like obama is winning when in fact that s not the case the new argument on the right is that if you reconfigure all ofthe mainstream polls to unskew if i them to make them be less liberal they don t look like this anymore with 20 straight polls for obama instead they look like this hey yeah that s way better mitt romney is actually winning all of the recent polls that you thought president obama was winning the guy who did this it neat trick the unskewing of the polling so mitt romney wins in every one instead of losing inevery one that guy explained his methodology to the folks at buzz feed saying he created this new romney always wins polling site quote after reading a washington post poll that just didn t look right noting that the polling had sampled more democrats than republicans sampling more democrats than republicans hm that sounds like a reasonable argument everybody might have reason to be suspicious of the polls showing president obama lead in if in fact pollsters are systemically oversampling democrats when doing their polling that s not what pollsters are doing they are not going out and looking for too many democrats for their polls in order to fill some quota to get the liberal result they want pollsters polling the swing states are finding more people calling themselves democrats in those swing states because there are more people calling themselves democrats in the swing states it's not a biassed look at the states it's a look at the states that show the states have a democratic bias that s why president obama is winning there the electrorates are leaning democratic just to create a whole new fantasy electorate to replace the real electorate because you don t like what the real electorate seems poised to do trying to turn the polls themselves into a controversy i was amazed when this happened today it moved on from being a source of skrept conservative psychological comfort it moved out of those corners of the internet to being the official line of the romney campaign itself mid afternoon today the romney campaign started leaking news that they say their internal polling data doesn t really have them losing ohio at all they say yes yes the polls show them losing ohio but their internal romney polls show mr romney specially tied in ohio at least they show romney inside the margin of error in ohio but again they are notreleasing this magical internal polling data they are saying that s what it says kind of like the summary of mitt romney s tax returns if it's true they have internal polling data doing great in ohio just in the interest of their donors shouldn t they release those numbers this isn t a magic thing this isn t a hypothetical thing in a real poll which we can see the data for we can see notonly that it in ohio president obama is up by eight we can see why president obama is up by eight in ohio that washington post poll out today has other data in it including the fact that 36 of all ohio voters say they have been contacted by the obama campaign that contacted by the campaign number is seven points lower in term ls of the romney campaign the obama campaign is doing it better they are talking to more voters in ohio that s making a difference the hill today reporting that it's not just ohio the obama campaign has double the number of field staff as the romney campaign and in a number of key swing state the obama folks have twice the number of field offices the l a times looked at the payroll numbers they find the obama campaign is employing twice the number of staff as the the romney campaign last month at about the same cost there are twice as many people working on the obama campaign if you exclude the 200 000 theromney campaign paid out in bonuses to its campaign officials last month the romney s payroll number wasstill roughly the same as president obama s even though president obama had double thenumber of boots on the ground fewer romney staff e but they get paid a lot more there s a reason president obama is ahead in the last 20 national polls there s a reason he s up by eight in the latest washington post poll in ohio his campaign is doing more and whichever way you skint at the data president obama is winning his effort at reelection now is when you see the signs of desperation there are two kinds of political desperation there s the aboveground december separation inventing a whole new polling method whereby your guy wins all the time instead of losing all the time because even fox news is in on the conspiracy to make it look like obama is winning that s aboveground desperation at least it's happening in thelight of day where everybody can see it here s what s happening a littlebelow the surface on the right this is what underground political desperation looks like 41 days before the election when the republican candidate is clearly losing this is a web ad just been released by a conservative outside group accusing president obama of being in bed with the muslim brotherhood which by the way is trying to take over america the group skponl for this ad says it's part of a 7 million online ad buy 7 million we spoke with this group to confirm the number because we couldn t believe it was that high they assured us this ad was part of a 7 million online ad buy that s just in online distribution for this ad and a number of others like it they will target voters online whether it turns up on tv remains to be seen tv ads are not in the works but they are talking to donors about that possibility but honestly we shall die as mar tars why mr president this kind of stuff usually functions better in the shadows than it does in the high profile settings where it can be scrutinized more widely another place for underground attacks associated with a lot of money is from our old friend ralph reid the new york times reporting that reid and his faith and freedom coalition is set to pour 12 million into their campaign this year andy kroll got his hands on what he was spending his money on it's labeled as a 2012 voter registration confirmation survey question one how do you rate barack obama s overall performance as president so far here are your choices excellent good fair poor abysmal undecided or i consider him an enemy of liberty and the values that built our vaet great nation a couple questions there s an issue summary that you have to read it's the statement of facts before you get to answer yourquestion here s the issue summary the statement of facts the anti american communist dictator hew voe chavez calls barack obama comrade obama and believes president obama is to the left of himself and fidel castro that s the issue summary these are the the facts now the question when fidel castro hailed the passage of obama care as a miracle do you think this is because he is honestly concerned with the well being of americans or is it more likely that cost troe sees obama care as the fastest way to bring socialism to america what do you think how much danger do you think liberty is in as a result of president obama s policies actions and agenda for america s future it's how much you have to kwuquantity fie thi it could be all of these more serious than the threats we faced in world war ii from naz si germany and the japanese because the attack on liberty today is from our own government that s one choice or more serious than the threat we face from the soviet union during the cold war or all of the above or serious but not as serious as the threats to liberty listed above for all the communist pollsters that s one of the choices you were asked if you will pledge right now on this survey to vote on november 6th if you are physically able to do so you have to fill in the bubble saying you re swearing to do it and you have to sign your name there to verify your pledge and also please send ralph reed some money will you send your best emergency freedom saving donation right now ralph reed is going to spend 12 million this election cycle that s a lot of postage for hilarious polls im sure ralph reed himself is doing well in terms of the cut he s taking for this surveying that he s doing but 12 million even minus the considerable fee that s got to be a lot of money that s a lot of comparing president obama to hitler and please sign here if you understand it and 7 million on the obama is inviting the muslim brotherhood to destroy america ad campaign that s a lot of money but this is what the campaign is going to start to look like from here on out when the campaign gets tough the campaigning gets weird and nasty and weirdly nasty joining us is a distinguished senior fellow bob thank you for being here a difficult survey right,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121130_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,yeah you know chris one of the things that s amplified some of the concerns around this is we had a classified briefing with about 65 or 70 senators on september the 20th and i assure you if you were there you would have thought it was one of the most bizarre briefings ever where we had four you know distinguished people there who shared like no information i was in libya about a week after that it was a preplanned trip i didn t go there because of benghazi obviously benghazi was a big topic and i sat there with our station chief our head intelligence person who was there serving after the ambassador had been killed and they were telling me that in real time they were letting folks back home know that this in fact was a terrorist attack and there was absolutely no protest so you can see how people have had concerns i think really and in talking to ambassador rice yesterday we had a very long meeting you know one of the things that she knows she shouldn t have said was that we have decimated al qaeda and i know that you know this because you re a student of what s happening in the world but certainly nothing can be further from the truth so i do think there have been some fairly legitimate concerns that this was all in the height of a political campaign and it really did appear that she was very anxious to make it appear that things were a little different in the middle east than they are look we can all get caught up in that and certainly we had a conversation to that effect yesterday but i will tell you as a person i think you asked me to come on because i hope you think im fairly level headed im really disgusted with everything from the intelligence to the security to you know the fbi i mean this whole thing really should not be where it is today and i do think that part of it is she s gotten caught up in some of the other things that although i have concerns and you have heard my concerns i do feel like,0

the campaign told reporters they were changing strategy if you seem to be in crisis make it look like you re taking charge and moving in a whole new direction it's important though to pick just one new direction to move in even in cleanup mode today the romney campaign was rutterless and chaotic telling some reporters that the new strategy was to go hard right to talk to base voters about patriotism and god and telling others to go very specific they won t be talking about patriotism and god they will be talking about policy will they offer new specifics to show how the campaign would operate no new specifics today but we promise we're going to get specific or we're going to go very nonspecific and go right wing or whatever we have no idea ideally elections are a way we solve problems in this country the country has challenges candidates put forward ideas how to address those challenges and we the people decide between those choices it's a crude form of decision making but it is what we ve got and when real national life or death challenges get ignored or skipped in an election we lose out as a country on the chance to debate competing ideas for how to fix those problems right now we need to have a debate between real and robust and serious and well informed competing ideas about how to solve a big problem that we have as a country because it's a big problem and what we're doing right now is not working on friday in southern afghanistan three coordinated teams of insurgents wearing american army uniforms infiltrated a military base called camp bastion it's received more press because britain s prince harry was on that base regardless of the royalty consider it was a big group of insurgents they were wearing american uniforms they killed two U.S. marines wounded nine other personnel eventually 14 of the attackers were killed but not before they caused that human damage and not before they destroyed what s said to be 200 million worth of equipment six jets destroyed two damaged six aircraft hangars and fueling stations destroyed they were reportedly armed with assault rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers that happened on friday on a nato base also on friday separate incident an afghan police officer shot and killed two british soldiers then on sunday another incident a group of afghan police officers shot and killed four american soldiers eight coalition troops killed in three days at least six of them killed by the afghan security forces whose training is our justification of being in that war most joint U.S. afghan military operations are suspended until further notice it was reported they would be suspended for a couple day but now the suspension is indefinite one official telling nbc it could be three days or three months a senior military official explaining the change by saying we're to the point now where we can't trust these people the reason that young american men and women talented ambitious accomplished men and women in the prime of their lives are tonight right now risking being killed thousands of miles away is because of the value that american policymakers have put on the mission to train afghan forces and those joint combat patrols that have now been called off indefinitely if there s a need for a debate about anything in american politics right now it would seem for a debate

was in trouble before today but what s driving this overwhelmly vicious news cycle for them is now people who work on the campaign are talking to reporters most notably in that politico story they are talking about each other and about mitt romney explaining who it is that they pl blame for the fact they are losing now one saying i also have this impression stewart must save his best stuff for meetings im not important enough to attend the campaign is filled with people who spend their time avoiding him or resisting him then there s the criticism of the candidate they are baffled that a successful corporate leader has created a team with so few lines of authority or accountability you expect a little of this from political professionals when their campaign is running behind but you do not expect the candidate himself to get attacked by his staffers who are still working as his staffers and you do not expect so much of the fire to be trained on the top guy in the campaign who is not being fired he s being kept in place is this just the kind of thing that happens in every campaign is this a nonsubstantive process freak out being driven by the press or is this real they make it seems like he s losing the election pbadly looking at the data looking at the fundamentals is usually a better way to grasp be longer view than looking at one day of headlines in one tough news cycle look at this here is the swing state and the maybe swing state now here is the latest polling that we have from the last few days in new hampshire president obama leading by five points in virginia president obama leading by five points in north carolina it's mitt romney by six points in florida it's president obama with a two point lead in pennsylvania president obamawith an 11 point lead and in ohio by seven points and in wisconsin mr obama by two points and in colorado it's mr obama with one point and in nevada the president leading by three points are you noticing a trend in terms of the issues which voters are deciding the race those look good for the president a brand new new york times cbs poll shows that president obama is erasing mitt romney s edgewhen it comes to who voters trust more on the committee among latino voters mr romney was at 26 then he went up to 30 after the republican convention he s now back down to 26 president obama has a 42 point lead among latino voters when you look at the biggest possible picture president obama is now up by three points nationally you look at all those things together you can understand why people who want president obama to be reelected are feeling like things are going their way if you want to be realistic not just gut check but a well informed perspective of what s going on here there s one dynamic and two numbers that you need to sort of get your head around the dynamic is those polls say when thing when you look at them as a snapshot but it makes more sense to look at them in motion and how they are changing over time and look at the trends they represent the poll has president obama leading by threepoints but over the past few days the number has shrunk it was six points and now it's three points he s still got a lead but it's contracting not expanding that s the dynamic at work now in the gallup poll the first number is about money we reported that mitt romney and the republicans raised more money month of may than obama and the democrats did romney and the republicans did that in june and in july in august they did not do that they did not president obama and the democrats out raised mitt romney and the republicans in august which was an unexpected development and one that made obama supporters feel very good nbc news today looked at the data of what money is being spent and by whom and it turns out that most of the money that is being spent to try to elect mitt romney president is not basic spent by mitt romney s campaign or by the republicans most of the money that s being spent to elect mitt romney is being spent by outside groups most of what is being spent for mitt romney is outside money most of the outside money overall in the whole country is pro romney here is the number look 75 75 of it is pro romney money 75 compare the campaigns but don t miss the big picture if you believe that money makes a difference as to who wins elections that is bottomless mostly untraceable money from deep pocketed donors who can give infinitely again and again when they are giving 775 of that money is pro romney one last number getting real about this it's the number i mentioned at the top of this segment 730 000 a tea party linked group called the ohio voter integrity project says it will challenge the eligibility of 730 000 registered voters in ohio nearly one out of every ten voters in ohio is going to have their registration challenged the cincinnati enquirer reporting on how the group has been testing the waters by trying to get voters thrown off the rolls the group says that nationwide they're moving statewide against more than 700 000 people in ohio to keep them from voting today was probably the worst day ever in terms of press and in terms of panic in the mitt romney campaign that was all before david corn and mother jones and huffington posted the visdeo saying that 4 of the government is dependent on government and looking for hand out because they can't be persuaded to vote for anything other than barack obama because they can't be persuaded to,1

you have a choice we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that create new jobs here in the united states of america we can help big factories and small businesses double theirexports and if we choose this path we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the nextfour years you can make that happen you can choose that future you can choose the path where we control more of our own energy after 30 years of inaction we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas we have doubled our use of renewable energy and thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries in the last year alone we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day more than any administration in recent history and today america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades so now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it we ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years and we ll open more but unlike my opponent i will not let oil companies write this country s energy plan or endanger our coastline or collect another 4 billion in cooperate welfare from our taxpayers we're offering a better path we're offering a better path where we a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal where farmers and scientists harvest new power our cars and trucks where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy where we develop 100 years supply of natural gas that s right beneath our feet if you choose this path we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600 000 new jobs in natural gas alone applause and yes my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax more droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke they are a threat to our children s future and in this election you can do something about it applause you can chose a future where more americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete no matter how old they are or how much money they have education was the gateway to opportunity for me it was the gateway for michelle it was the gateway for most ofyou and now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle class life for the first time in a generation nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning some of the worst schools in the country ve made real gains inmath and reading millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders and now you have a choice we can gut education or we can decide that in the united states of america no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don t have the money no company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn t find any with the right skills here at home that s not our future that is not our future a government has a role in this but teachers must inspire principals must lead parents must instill a thirst for learning and students you ve got to do the work and together i promise you we can outeducate and out compete any nation on earth so help me help me recruit 100 000 math and science teachers within ten years and improve early childhood education help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills in their community college that will lead directly to a job help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next ten years we can meet that goal together you can choose that future for america that s our future you know in a world of new threats and new challenges you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven four years ago i promised to end the war in iraq we did i promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and we have we ve blunted the taliban s momentum in afghanistan and in 2014 our longest war will be over a new tower rises above the new york skyline al qaeda is on the path to

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,sean welcome to hafnlt today was supposed to be the day that critical questions were finally answered about the benghazi terror attack top administration officials appeared on coop tol hill capitol hill to testify but we are learning that it was more of the same from team obama questions that went unanswered finger pointing and thanks to the least transparent white house in history it appears the widespread coverup continues hear directly from two congressmen who were in the room to hear the testimony of the director of national intelligence james clapper and the acting cia director michael morel the major flashpoint came when administration officials were pressed on the so called benghazi talking points in other words who was responsible for creating the false narrative that the attack was the result of a youtube video and who sent ambassador rice on five separate sunday shows to tell the world to rest easy because al qaeda was not responsible sadly our sources have told us that neither person provided answers to the important critical questions so republicans are now demanning that a select committee be formed to investigate this matter one was formed to look into watergate but unlike watergate this scandal cost lives four brave americans are dead and a united states ambassador was assass nail theed for the first time in more than 30 years that s apparently not enough to capture the attention of this president he is busy with far more important matters do you know what he just finished doing a short time ago at the white house according to his official schedule he just hosted a v i p private viewing of the new movie lincoln which by the way you paid for mr president i hope you were taking notes and learned a thing or two about honesty and integrity while you were watching it because while you sat in your private theater with your popcorn the family members of the benghazi victims are at home waiting for you to finally come clean about what really happened on that fateful day in other words what did you know when did you know it joining me with the developing story two men in the room for the closed hearing peter king and joe heck gentlemen welcome back to hannity,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,want all we wanted to learn specifically sean you mentioned the talking points the intelligence community was asked said that when they prepared the talking points they had language in there saying that al qaeda affiliated groups were directly involved in the attack when the talk points left the intelligence community and went somewhere thy couldn t tell us where but they did admit one of the places was the white house when the talking points came back that language was taken out and it said there was an indication that extremist groups might be involved so someone deliberately watered down the talking points so when the president says that susan rice was giving out talking about the most updated and the fully documented intelligence that the intelligence community had that s not true because there were a number of analysis that had been done in the three days leading up to the talking points which clearly showed by the intelligence community s own analysis that al qaeda affiliated groups were directly involved this is a total sham,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,well the video that was obtained from the unmanned aerial vehicle showed what was going on on the ground from a distance and grainy and difficult to decipher but shows the ongoing attack and the buildings burning and a potential road block not far from the compound the question we posed was who saw that video and when likewise like they couldn t answer the question about the talking points they couldn t answer who from the national security authority whether it was the president or the secretary of defense or anybody else from the national security council whether or not they were watching that live as our consulate was under attack with a missing U.S. ambassador that s a question that needs to be answered why wasn t those officials looking at that video when it was spontaneously available,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,sean okay fundamentally what i would like to know congressman king if the state department knew this was an attack the intelligence committee prepared statements and they said this was al qaeda related five days later susan rice is telling the american people something that is factually inaccurate and two weeks later at u n and answering questions in two separate media interviews when the president s asked he is referring to the youtube video how is that possible,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,it is not to me it cannot be justified it cannot be plained because the intelligence community s own analises we saw the memos today they said that al qaeda affiliated groups were directly involved in these attacks there is no way this can be explained in fact certainly on the videos there is no sign of any demonstration there was no demitration you know they say the different reports coming in always there is always a fog of war but the preponderance of the evidence from the start was this this was clearly a terrorist directed attack but general petraeus briefed us and discounted that and said it was not a terrorist attack there may have been terrorists in the crowd but there are terrorists everywhere in libya,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,well if he does i wish he would but if he does why did he give us such a wrong report on september 14 because based on the documentation we saw today he had the information available to him showing him it was a very heavily involved terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,sean this is very important you are saying there is no possible way that two weeks later the president could not have known this is a terror attack that s my interpretation you can ask joe i don t know how any logical person could have made that conclusion,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,it was certainly clear in the initial reporting from the intelligence community that there was a deliberate terrorist attack that seemed to be watered down over the next couple of weeks and they came back 180 degrees to where they were initially that this was a deliberate terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,it's pretty disappointing the logical extension is let s only send out white males because they can't be attacked for gender or race president obam ain the debate was adamant that called this a terror attack from day 1 if that is true why does susan rice go out three days later or petraeus go out 3 days later and rice go out 5 days later candy crowley rescued him i said it was a terror attack from day 1,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,the station cia station chief on the ground immediately called it a terror attack related to al qaeda,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,sean on the petraeus front and on this issue that if he the white house sent out susan rice and she had a story that was false five days later and he s advancing a false narrative two weeks later i would be pretty angry he seemed angrier at the attacks on susan rice i have to run coming up we have laid out the time line compared the stories from all the major players and asked the necessary questions but perhaps the question with the most consequence what if the president lied about benghazi and what if in fact he knew about this much earlier you just heard congressman king and heck say there is no way that the president didn t know two weeks later that this was a terror attack and he kept blaming a youtube video we will check in with david limbaugh and peter johnson jr limbaugh and peter johnson jr and look at forsythe we don t just come up here for the view up in alaska it's the cleanest clearest water we fd the best sweetest crab for red lobster that we can find male announr hurry in to rd lobster s crabfest the only time of year you can savor 5 succulent crab entrees all under 20 dollars like a half pound tender snow crab paired with savory grilled shrimp st 12 99 or our hearty crab and roasted garlic seafood bake forsythe if i wouldn t pt on my table at home i wouldn t bring it in my name s jon forsythe and i seaood differently is bigger than we think sometimelike the flu fer from with aches fever and chills the flU.S. a really big deal so why treat it like it's a little cold there s something that works differently than over the counter remedies prescription tamiflu attacks the flu virus at its source so don t wait call your doctor right away tamiflu is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days before taking tamiflu tell your doctor if you re pregnant nursing have serious health conditions or take other medicines if you develop an allergic reaction a severe rash or signs of unusual behavior stop taking tamiflu and call your doctor immediately children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures confusion or abnormal behavior the most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting the flu comes on fast so ask your doctor about tamiflu prescription for flu that s the sound of car insurance compani these days here a cheap there a cheap everywhere a cheap you get it so what if instead of just a cheap choice you could make a smart choice like esurance for example they were born online and built to save people money from the beginning it's what they ve always done not just something they cheap about that s insurance for the modern world esurance now backed by allstate click or call,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,if that s true he is the most incompetent disengaged chief executive we have ever had they spun this narrative consciously they sent susan rice on five shows to make three points that they had substantial security that there was no breakdown in security in benghazi they had taken care of our own people that this was not the result of a terror attack and third that it was the result of a video all three of those things have been conclusively shown lies and obama has the audacity to be outraged to be questioned about it and gets up in mccain s and graham s face and dares them to go after him and portrays susan rice as a victim when of course she might be his victim but she s not the victim of senator mccain and graham he was either duped by obama or she lied herself,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,there is a generic reference to teror and disparate stories therefore i think we know from congressman king s interview with you he was talking about an altered an altered talking point he said the intelligence people put forward that the that an al qaeda affiliated organization was involved in the attack somehow as it got to susan rice s presentation on five talk shows she won t talk to fox news she ignored her crew in the airport they haven t responded to fox news it changed why,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121116_050000_Hannity,everything was political with this administration sean petraeus resigns three days after the election and six days before he s scheduled to testify you can't tell me that wasn t orchestrated obama feigns outrage representing susan rice as an expert he said he didn t know anything about fast furious he said he didn t know anything about benghazi being a terrorist attack he said he didn t know anything about petraeus he cannot possibly not know he said he wasn t informed about petraeus yet the fbi was investigating he said he can't answer questions about whether he was informed because an investigation s going on well whether an investigation s going on doesn t keep him from admiding what he knows about whether he was informed cya for obama,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121113_010000_Anderson_Cooper_360,there s still a lot we don t know tonight analysts say there s no evidence no evidence that the affair led to any security breaches and that there are strict fbi protocols about who gets notified in this kind of investigation but the timing of when the scandal broke right after election day and right before petraeus was scheduled to testify in the attack on the U.S. consulate in benghazi libya certainly has a lot of people asking a lot of questions und understandably the other angle to the story is an age old tale of an affair between a highly respected man in washington and a younger woman in this case the woman who literally wrote the book on the general paula broadwell the two met when she was a graduate student in harvard she later traveled to afghanistan interviewed petraeus interviews that led to all in the education of general david petraeus the revelation about the affair is bringing new interest in all the interviews broadwell did to promote the book and what she said about petraeus at that time take a look,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121113_010000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well that s a bombshell accusation as you know the cia lost its ability legally to detain people so for paula broadwell to go out in public and say that the cia was holding prisoners and that that prompted the attack at benghazi that killed the american ambassador is huge she didn t give her source when she made that speech and she also said that it was unveted material so that raises the very serious issue of the kind of access that she had to the director of the cia we don t know if that information came from him but just knowing how close the two of them were and that oftentimes you know if you needed a response on something even as a journalist you would go to paula to get it because they're a lot quicker than the office of public affairs at the cia she had that kind of instant access to him,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121113_010000_Anderson_Cooper_360,this thing that broadwell had mentioned about cia holding prisoners in benghazi and that might have been the reason behind the attack she said was kind of unsourced or unverified information do you think there s any truth to that and b do you think she was just kind of if there s no truth to it do you think she was just talking based on you know trying to make herself look more important than she was,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121113_010000_Anderson_Cooper_360,as you know the general obviously was deeply involved in the ongoing investigation the attacks on benghazi he was scheduled to testify later this week did he tell you whether or not he still intends to give testimony at a later date,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121105_020000_Hannity,i was stunned at the revenge comment mitt romney hit the right cone said no i am running for the american people let me run this again i want to run them side by side it is so glaring the difference you can see in their closing arguments here the president is on the attack trying to energize his base mitt romney is appealing to independents independents have seen the polls voting for mitt romney look at the difference between the two,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121025_020000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think it's willfully misleading the american public to interrupt the narrative we got bin laden and al qaeda on the run and by the way al qaeda is not on the run all over northern africa northern mali doubled in iraq et cetera so it interfered with that rhetoric they are either misleading or the degree of incompetence and lack of acting on existing information such as the previous attacks on the consulate in benghazi for example is absolute total incompetence,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121110_110000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,president obama spoke publicly the night that he won his second term when he gave his basic victory speech in chicago thereafter though he did speak privately to some of his campaign volunteers in chicago we likely would have never known about that or seen any tape of those remarks if not for the fact that the president while he was speaking with those volunteers he did something which he almost never does he choked up and he started crying when he was thanking his volunteers so that tape ended up being very widely seen that was not a public event today s remarks in the east room of the white house were the first time that president obama has made an official public statement of any kind since election night you can tell that in part by the huge round of applause he got as he walked into the room applause from people invited to attend the speech and a bunch of white house staffers who may have not seen the president and vice president since they earned themselves another term and ensured all of those white house staffers continuing employment at the white house for the next four years so needless to say everybody in that room was all very happy to see him and in these remarks that he gave today though the president proposed that congress act right now to extend the bush tax cuts that are due to expire at the end of the year the president said democrats and republicans both agree that those tax cuts should be extended for all income under a quarter million dollars a year and so he said congress should pass legislation to just do that right now since everybody agrees on it even if the two sides are likely to keep fighting about what the tax rates should be for income above a quarter million dollars a year he s essentially saying let s take action on what we agree on and let s keep debating on what we disagree on the president took his pen out of his pocket and waved it in the air at one point in these remarks today said he was ready to sign a bill doing that extension of the bush tax cuts right now that moment from him was going to be the biggest news in american politics today until exactly one hour and 45 minutes later when andrea mitchell nbc s chief foreign affairs correspondent broke into msnbc programming at 2 51 this afternoon with a remarkable scoop you know everybody in everybody in washington everybody in politics right now so focused on figuring out what s going to happen in the obama administration s second term there s two components one of them is policy and fighting stuff out with congress like you saw the president address in those remarks today in the east room but the other side of it the other side of what everybody is obsessed with right now is who s the obama administration for the president s second term when andrea mitchell got on air today at 2 51 p m and announced that general david petraeus was resigning unexpectedly and immediately as head of the cia that second question in washington the question of who is going to hold the most important jobs in the obama administration now who is going to run the country on a day to day basis this thing that everybody knows is due to change dramatically for the second term at 2 51 today when andrea got on the air on msnbc that stuff started to change already when andrea mitchell broke this news about general rhett payous we're going to speak with richard engle about this in a moment about what the news of general petraeus means for the winning of that part of the government we ll be talking with andrea about her scoop today in order to appreciate how big a deal this is how surprising it is how not just consequential but potentially further consequential this thing is that happened today you should know that before this was a reportable story before it was clear what had actually happened and that andrea was going to be able to report the reasons for general petraeus saying he was resigning we were hearing all sorts of things about potential reasons why he might be resigning maybe he had irreconcilable political differences with president obama he had to resign because of some huge political disagreement it was rumored before andrea s report that maybe general petraeus had been in talks to take a job with the romney administration he had been plotting that move behind president obama s back and the disloyalty was the reason he had to go there was speculation he would have to step down because of something related to the benghazi consulate attack which he was scheduled to testify about next week before congress before this was a reportable story and we knew for sure that he was going and why the theories and the breathless speculation about why david petraeus was resigning from the cia went all the way up to and included the idea that maybe he was stepping down to start running as a republican for president in 2016 right now until we knew what happened people were crawling up the walls about this announcement from david petraeus today and then andrea broke the story and david petraeus it turns out is leaving the cia because he had an extramarital affair it was a personal matter just an unbelievable news day today joining us now is andrea mitchell nbc s chief foreign affairs correspondent and the host of msnbc s andrea mitchell reports congratulations on this scoop thanks for being here,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120928_010000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,that was mitt romney speaking today in springfield virginia to the american legion and no he is still not apparently able to say anything about the war directly but at least today where you saw him there he did mention that this war has produced an outcome of war which is american war veterans neither the war nor its veterans were mentioned of course in mr romney s speech to the nation upon becoming his party s nominee for president he s trying to fix the veteranspart of that oversight he really as a candidate still seems incapable of talking about the war he would be taking over as commander in chief there were these duelingappearances in virginia before military heavy audiences in that military heavy state president obama talking about ending the war in iraq talking about his strategy in afghanistan president obama released a two minute tv ad today sort of his closing argument for his campaign in the two minute ad he talks about what the country should do with the savings that we will obtain when we eventually end the war in afghanistan but while mr romney did mention veterans in his virginia speech today he did not say what he would do to improve the problem that he identified for veterans in fact the way he talked about it indicated he might not know even which part of the government is supposed to fix a problem like that and he still can't bring himself to talk about what he would do as commander in chief he still can't bring himself to talk about the war that we are still in that is now producing new veterans every day and is due to keep doing that for another couple of years in any other election year with any other candidate who was more capable of holding his own on this issue we would be having a debate on this issue we would be having a big national debate on this subject right now because it very obviously needs debating wired magazine today published this internal assessment from the U.S. military in afghanistan and it shows sort of inadvertently what the effect has been of the big obama troop surge in the war in 2009 after he was inaugurated and there was a summertime surge of violence and attacks in afghanistan president obama took several months in 2009 to do an intensive review of american strategy in the war you ll remember that he announced that the end of that review at the end of 2009 in december that he was going to send tens of thousands more american troops into afghanistan the idea they said was to blunt the taliban s momentum so here s the data he waslooking at in terms of what the taliban s momentum was when he made his decision to send the surge what you re looking at there on the left is the calendar year it's what the military in afghanistan calls enemy initiated attacks all the years of all fights in afghanistan all have that general sort of pattern where it peaks in the summer and drops in the winter that s what they call the fighting season in afghanistan looking at that see what the overall level was that was the first calendar year president obama was president after looking at those numbers he decided to do the surge that s the level of violence he was looking at when he sent more troops at the end of that year now three years later after the surge has ended this is the level of attacks in this calendar year in 2012 so over 2010 and 2010 during the surge right we endured this level of enemy initiated that s during the surge we endured that level of enemy initiated attacks now after the surge after all of that blood and treasure and sacrifice we have a new level which is higher than when we started so that s for enemy nisinitiate attacks here s the same number for executed ied attacks so bombs in afghanistan right here was the rather outrageously high numbers of bombs in afghanistan in 2009 whenpresident obama was making his decision about the surge these are ieds here s the level now here s what we went throughduring the surge years the interim years that s 2010 and 2011 so you know it's possible to spin this as oh look 2012 is slightly better than last year looks like it might be right that wasn t the point the idea was that it was supposed to get better than when we started the surge this deadline that the president set for leaving at the end of 2014 was prefaced on the idea that the surge would have created some better environment from which it would make sense we could leave because things would be better if that promise is wrong and things after the surge are worse than before the surge if things are not going to get better by the time we are set to leave then why are we sticking with that as still being the time to leave when the pentagon announced the end of the surge last week whenthey announced the surge was over they talked less about blunting taliban momentum and more about how the surge helped us train lots of afghan security forces in theory lots of trained afghan security forces is a way afghanistan could get more safe but right now it's also a way americans get killed by the afghans we are training and arming afghan troops are turning around and killing american troops they're supposed to be working with at such a rate now that the training and joint operations between the two forces were halted this month and have only now started to scale back up that s the circumstances in which 68 000 americans are putting their lives on the line right now while you watch this tv show 68 000 there is a debate to have here about what we are doing in afghanistan things are worse after the surge than they were before the surge what was the surge for why does the deadline for leaving stay the same if the surge was supposed to make things better and it didn t if the republicans had picked a candidate who was capable of engaging in this debate we would be having this debate as a country we did it in the last two elections when we were at war we're still at war but we apparently can't do it in this election because mitt romney has nothing to say on this it's not a debate it's one guy talking and nobody answering other republicans below the presidential candidate level are willing to have this debate this is from the tampa bay times over and over every time the subject of pulling troops out of afghanistan republican congressman bill young has voted to stay the course he opposed resolutions to withdraw and even a resolution to set a timetable for withdrawal but not anymore i think we should removeourself from afghanistan as quickly as we can says congressman young i just think we're killing kids that don t need to die this is the longest serving republican member of congress he chairs the subcommittee that funds the pentagon in the house he describes himself as a stay the course politician since the days of the vietnam war but he now says he is done he is over it and you know what he s not alone most americans are done we are over it more than two thirds of the country says the U.S. should not be involved in afghanistan anymore and that is not a partisan figure when you re looking at 69 that s too high to be a partisanfigure if nothing else there s a political debate to have here between two responsible competing ideas for what to do in the longest war in american history that s already in year 11 and that is not slated to end this year and that is not slated to end next year and that is not slated to end until the end of the year of that that right now is the democratic party s position as embodied by the democratic president does the republican party have a competing idea nobody knows,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120911_230000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,at some point in time in the immediate aftermath of the attacks i thought about why didn t we know this i knew we needed to figure out what went wrong to prevent other attacks but i didn t want to start the finger pointing you know and say to ourintelligence communities you fouled up you should have caught this why didn t you know,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120911_230000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,perhaps one reason they failed to catch this was because his administration neglected the threat in the lead ups to the attacks according to an article by kurt eichenwald the white house quote failed to take significant action on multiple warnings by the intelligence community on may 1st of 2001 the cia warned that a group presently inthe united states was planning a terrorist operation the warnings continued throughout the summer of 2001 with increasing urgency leading up to a now infamous august 6th briefing entitled bin laden determined to strike in the U.S. eichenwald writes that officialsat the counterterrorism center of the cia were so frustrated and so convinced an attack was coming they suggested transferring so as not to be blamed when the attack took place all told it's a devastating portrait roger cressey is an nbc news terrorism analyst and was deputy for counterterrorism at the national security council on september 11 shg 2001 michael tomasky is special correspondent for newsweek and the daily beast let me start with roger let at the start with roger you have been on this show so often about this question aboutwhat we knew what we could have known where do you think you are right now after reading this article,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_020000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,im not sure but we ve all been scratching our heads over theories because there really is a reason to investigate benghazi and that s to investigate why after five attacks not just intelligence warnings but attacks why the consulate wasn t closed why security wasn t beefed up that s why a high powered group ordered by hillary clinton under law is investigating by the state department it's led by the former chairman of the joint chiefs and ambassador tom pickering men of the highest caliber they have a group that s going to report very soon hillary clinton said she will not leave office before she personally presented it to congress which she is mandated to do so this is going to be an uncomfortable exit for secretary clinton because she s going to have to answer as to why the state department did not improve security that s what presumably these senators would be investigating so jay carney and others in the white house are trying to say why what was said on sunday morning television which is not under oath and not out of the old or new testaments why that s become rit so large and why we're going through this with someone who has not yet been nominated that s all rather curious,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121103_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,spare change real change that was mitt romney s closing argument today in wisconsin and ohio a vote for me is a vote for real change and tonight just outside cincinnati the romney campaign attempting to underscore that message by holding a big mega rally in westchester ohio featuring nearly 100 governors senators congressmen and other republican luminaries to talk about the real change you would get if you elect mitt romney so who did he enlist to sell this message of what real change he s offering america the headliners were george w bush s secretary of state george w bush s labor secretary the governor and current speaker of the house mitt romney change you can believe in if you really liked george w bush and if you like the current republican congress then we're the kind of real change we're looking for who cast this thing the democrats one of the reasons that the message of real change resonated back in 2008 because the country at large had ceased to be delighted by the george w bush administration and it wasn t just the war in iraq or or or or it was stuff like this this is the U.S. state department s annual report on global terrorism in 2003 every year they would put together a report like this detailing accidents of terrorism around the world and the next report after this one showed that despite the bush administration s claims that we were winning the war on terror despite the constant claims the number of terrorist attacks had gone up to its highest level in the two decades the state department had been publishing this report what was the bush administration s solution to that problem the solution was to stop publishing the report the bush administration just eliminated that annual report once it included something very politically inconvenient the bush administration had a habit of doing this if you don t like the data get rid of the data earlier they were faced with a new report from their own education department showing that charter school kids were falling behind public school kids how do you deal with your own administration s data on underperforming charter schools you cut back on the data that you collect about charter schools the bush administration just announced they would be collecting less data going forward in 2003 after the bush administration labor department report detailed mass layoffs in the manufacturing sector the bush administration announced they were going to stop publishing information about mass layoffs if we get rid of the data pointing to a problem maybe the data wouldn t look so bad the obvious move is to get rid of it this was a hall mark of the george w bush administration and it appears to be one of the things that mr romney liked very much about the george w bush administration it at least appears to be one of the things that he s promising to bring back you don t like the data presented kill the report after the totally unimpeachable ly did a report concluded that romney s plan would be great for rich people and hurt everybody else the response to that was to go guns blazing against the center you don t like the message shoot the messenger last month after the bureau of labor statistics announced the unemployment rate was going down the right started attacking the bureau of labor statistics as if they were the problem because they said the unemployment rate was going down it used to be that democrats and republicans would argue about how best to deal with some factual things some problem facing the national now republicans do it differently they do it differently than everybody else this is not a mirror image problems on both sides they refuse to acknowledge factual thing they are still doing it was brought to a whole new level last week when it was revealed that a nonpartisan tax report was withdrawn by a federal agency because republicans protested its findings the federal agency in question here is the congressional resource service they're kind of the gold standard congress s internal think tank members of congress have a question about policy or issue they look into it for them and they issue a report in response to a member of congress asking for that report the congressional research service is as nonpartisan as it gets in washington and a little more than a month ago they issued a report on tax policy they found there is no connection between lowering the tax rates on millionaires and billionaires and creating economic growth there s no evidence that if you cut taxes on the rich that that makes the economy grow that s a problem because that is essentially mitt romney s whole reason for living this is the republican party s economic reason for existing if you cut taxes on the rich the job creators that will jump start the economy this is the whole basis of the party economic philosophy this is why congressional republicans pledge their first born children to a man named grover and here comes this highly respected agency that says it turns out the whole thing is bunk giving rich people a tax break doesn t help the economy but it sure does help rich people what do you do if you re the republican party you pressure the agency into burying the report which is exactly what republicans in congress did this fall the new york times is reporting that the congressional research service quietly withdrew their entire report reportedly against the advice of their own economics experts this is amazing right if a report tells you something you do not want to hear get rid of the report especially if that report is coming out on the eve of a big election and it debunks your candidate s whole economic argument luckily breaking news the report does still exist you can find it right now you can read it right now it's not written very long you can find it at maddowblog com and there is nothing that republicans can do to stop that we will see you again on sunday night,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,the classified materials are different from the unclassified but they are not different when it comes to a discussion of many of the major elements what bothers me a great deal is the president of libya himself was saying this was a terrorist attack that they had arrested 50 people and that there had been al qaeda influence to individuals from other countries that had come in and that it was premeditated and planned and i just don t understand why the administration would have susan rice go on television and say that the views essentially of the president of libya just didn t matter she completely discounted them that doesn t make sense to me,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,it may have inspired some of the people who later entered the compound but i have not seen evidence that it was the cause of the violent attack on our personnel in benghazi that caused four americans their lives and certainly ambassador rice s statement on abc news said it was the direct result was not accurate today she told me she did not intend to say what she said on abc,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,this was in the new york times about what we know now of the attacks of benghazi this is the new york times straight reporting on the ground accounts indicate that miss rice s description of the attack though wrong in some respects was accurate in others witnesses to the assault said it was carried out by members of al shariah the militant group without any warning or protest in retaliation for american made video mocking the prophet muhammad is that the truth as you know it,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,now david corn washington bureau chief for mother jones the senator just said her complaint or concern about the ambassador s position on the sunday shows in the days after the attack of our facility in benghazi is not that she was con trained by not being able to use classified material but that she took the material she was given shaped it politically and used it to protect the president s narrative that winning in libya was a clean win there was no complication of an emerging al qaeda related organization there,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,i think you sum it up right i will give her credit for admitting what a lot of people on the right haven t that it was a confusing situation the new york times ap have reported from the ground that while the people who launched the attack seemed to come in not as a protest but as they came in they rounded up people and they told people while they were mounting the attack they were mad about the film it might have been premeditated they were using the film which was in the news,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121129_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,they're attributing more al qaeda to this attack and this group this was a militia well established in benghazi they had been working with the government there to do security it wasn t an al qaeda,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120922_010000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you see the problem with the message there the romney ryan message in their official campaign there is we need to drastically change medicare might be okay for people using it now also i have a mother i want to throw the word bankrupt out there if you like medicare we have serious changes in mind the democratic message is the republicans want to make serious changes to medicare the republican message is the republicans want to make serious changes to medicare this doesn t usually happen this way the republican s campaign verifies and underscores the validity of the democrat s most potent attack with this crucial group of people in this crucial state on this crucial issue i know that mitt romney approves that message of that ad you just saw but i ll get barack obama approves that message too joining us now is karen finney a former communications director for the democratic party because i mentioned naral she is a board member at naral pro choice america you a political pro what does it mean when one side is running ads saying how scary that side s position is and the other side is saying yeah we're saying the exact same thing,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,good evening im chris matthews in washington let me start with this there s a real battle going on tonight john mccain is out there on every television show accusing u n ambassador susan rice of covering up a national security breach he says rice denied al qaeda s lead role in the attack on the U.S. consulate in benghazi that cost the lives of ambassador chris stevens and three others and she did so knowing it was true well the man who defeated mccain in the 2008 presidential campaign takes this as a personal shot at him how will he respond will he name ambassador rice his new secretary of state to replace hillary clinton will he meet mccain s challenge head on and send rice up to the capitol to go face to face with the enemy tonight we study the battlefield and the firepower of the two sides in this year ending fire fight mccain sure wants this fight but do his fellow republicans do they want an older white guy taking on the competence of a young woman of color a rhodes scholar of solid reputation most important what end does the president want for this match of fact and wits im joined by michael o hanlon of the brookings institution and jonathan landay the intelligence reporter for mcclatchy newspapers michael thank you for this i want to get to the facts am i right is the main charge here coming from mccain and the others that ambassador rice knowingly covered up a national security breach for political purposes,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,so jonathan thank you for joining us this is an argument about fact i don t know how to address it except the argument being made by mccain by lindsey graham and by senator ayotte of new hampshire is that this ambassador to the u n went on all the national shows including meet the press in mid september and basically tried to delay the news because it would get out eventually that it was al qaeda that launched this attack does that pass the smell test that somebody would knowingly do that knowing the truth would be coming out in a matter of days,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,we are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got and some that we didn t get concerning evidence that was overwhelming leading up to the attack on our consulate,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_070000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,well i think the president has already said that social security should be outside of this discussion it has not contributed to the deficit and it shouldn t be part of the discussion i think the press office said that the other day we completely agree with that we should set social security aside it is solvent for decades and by simply kicking in the social security tax above 250 000 you can make it solvent for decades more so that s less of an issue i think in reality than it is in the long time republican desire to attack it whenever they can remember this is a party that tried to put it into the stock market just before the crash,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121116_080000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,that s pretty close to it piers very good source of mine who is directly familiar with what general petraeus plans to try and say on capitol hill tomorrow behind closed doors is laying that out there s basically two threads here who was responsible what was their motivation so they had all this extra intelligence all these reports coming in that that anti islam video which sparked riots in cairo was possibly the motivation for some of the attacks as well at least that s the theory that s how it's going to go petraeus will say we are told that the cia was able to disprove that that the video at the end of the day didn t have much to do with it if anything but the problem is that disproving of that theory came after he first testified and briefed capitol hill and apparently after ambassador susan rice made those comments,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121116_080000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,let s turn to suzanne kelly the fascinating thing again today was the senators allowed in to see this video this closed circuit television video that included very disturbing scenes of ambassador stevens last moments but also it seemed to clarify didn t it exactly what was going on in the buildup to this attack there was no obvious sign according to the senators who have come out publicly after this of any protest,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121116_080000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,reporter it's very difficult to assess who s at fault for this one of the things that s almost obsolete is to try to lay blame on anyone or to say who actually started any of this but it certainly seems to be the case that of course the united states is saying all this is square on the shoulders of hamas because of the escalations that have been happening from gaza especially the rocket attacks but also attacks with anti tank weapons on israeli patrols in the past couple weeks that have been racheted up then you have a whole new player who is doing a lot right now and that is egypt that s taking a very firm stance calling this an israeli aggression but one of the interesting things that tony blair the former british prime minister said he said of course right now everybody is on the phone everybody is trying to negotiate everybody is trying to bring the violence to an end but at this point in time it certainly looks very much as though things are escalating rather than deescalating and that is certainly the message that we are getting from the israeli defense forces,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well august 6 is most certainly an historical document that says here s how you might think about al qaeda a warning is when you have something that suggests that an attack is impending and we did not have on the united states threat information that was in any way specific enough to suggest that something was coming in the united states,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,former secretary of state and national security adviser condoleezza rice there kirk eikenwald concedes her argument is plausible but says he s seen portions of many security briefs and come to an inescapable conclusion that administration s reaction that mr bush was told those were his words we have not seen what he says he s seen he joins us shortly to talk about it we do know from the report of the 9 11 commission that there were 40 other mentions of osama bin laden and al qaeda in presidential daily briefs prior to 9 11 but he goes further than that and reports direct warnings about the al qaeda attacking the U.S. began in the spring of twun the cia told the white house that a group in the united states was planning a terrorist operation he says the june 22 daily brief reported that al qaeda strikes could be imminent this tracks with the recollection of richard clarke who served in the clinton and bush administrations and haswritten a sharply critical book about his experiences he told nbc news about a june ñ1 meeting he sat in on with condoleezza rice and the cia director he said quote,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,again that is sharply disputed by members of the bush administration butit does track with what mr eikenwald is saying today he joins us now also with us is ari fleischer so you acknowledge at the end of your op ed there s no way to be sure that the bush administration could have prevented the attacks but you use the word negligence to describe their actions how do you reconcile the daylight in those statements there were a number of warnings and advisories that went out a lot of them for overseas postings for U.S. military for ambassadors but also some in the unitedstates as well,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,well there s a huge difference between putting the government on high alert and saying we're going to put out some warnings the last time prior to the summer of 2001 the last time there had been anything on the scale of what they were seeing at that period was in decemberof 1999 and at that point the entire government went on high alert you had in fact the counterterrorist center at the cia was told blow through your budget and they spent everything they had from january through september in about 15 days and multiple terrorist attacks were stopped including one in the united states we don t remember much about this because everything was stopped now was the bush administrat n administration did they have enough information to take the same kind of action all of the people who were involved in the 1999 intelligence gathering and in the gathering in the summer of 2001 tell me they were virtually identical it was the same level of severity,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,yeah anderson that s exactly right one september 11 is the day we should remember the victims you know i do not think it's appropriate on a day like this for somebody to leave out so many facts attack one person especially when the attack is so over the top partisan and we all know his politics are very rapidly anti republican im surprised the new york times would have printed such a piece on a day like today it's just wrong to do it today but two on the facts of it if what he was saying was accurate the 9 11 commission would have picked up on it they had access to every presidential daily brief and reach nod such conclusion in the summer of 2001 when the head of the cia said the system was blinking red it was all about europe or asia,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,this is the 9 11 commission report this is what they said about the warnings in the summer of 2001 we cannot say for certain whether those reports as dramatic as they were related to the 9 11 attacks the focus was abroad and that s where action was taken because there s where the intelligence led,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,and those reports had been prevalent since the late 1990s i suspect today there are reports about people active in the united states the issue is was there actionable intelligence this is what is so frustrating about intelligence it was true then and will always be true intelligence is always inprecise nobody ever said that we haveinformation that there s going to be a hijackings of airplanes used to fly into buildings in september of 2011 or any other time frame none of that was the case we have vague generalized reporting just as president clinton had the same he only faults george bush on the 9 11 commission actually faulted george bush president clinton the cia the fbi the department of justice it was a much more context report if anything he s said in his reporting and they never had the heart of what he says which is other pdbs gave credence to the fact that this was an attack that could have been stopped,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that s true because there wasn t the same kind i want to address a number of things that ari just said i mean number one i want to point out his first approach was attack the messenger number two i am quoting from presidential daily briefs ari is not coming in here and saying oh i have other information i don t know what he s saying is he saying im just lying and making them up ari this is what it says,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120912_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,absolutely not ari the 9 11 commission did not get the pdbs authorized for release which means they could not refer to them now there were also many people on the 9 11 commission who did not have the classification authority to look at the pdbs number two you want to make this all about politics you want to attack the messenger give me one fact one brief im citing im working at the disadvantage of actually having read them which you haven t,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121024_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,president obama on the attack last night joining me now a man who has a lot to say about that particular debate foreign policy new york times columnist nick kristof welcome back the president was actually wrong about it there s a pedantic piece of literature that proves this we actually have more bayonets than we had in 1916 over 650 000,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121024_040000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,yeah i think one of the best moments that mitt romney had last night was he was getting attacked by obama who said we can't go back to the policies of the bush years and romney said i want to go forward just not forward with the policies we ve had in place the last four years obama s taken a lot of flack for not having a very clear plan today his campaign put out this sort of 20 page glossy booklet they will hand out at rallies now that says this is barack obama s agenda for a for the next four years the problem is it's a lot of the same things we ve already heard trying to be dispassionate as a republican when obama was elected i supported mccain but i thought let s see what this guy can do he had a lot of big promises im going to slow the rate of tuition growth so that it's lower than inflation and things like that things that just didn t happen when you look at this new 20 page glossy plan they ve put out it's a lot of the same what s barack obama s plan for fixing education he s going to slow tuition growth but he doesn t say how it's going to happen i think you got to realize the plan is different than a goal he doesn t have a plan that s the problem,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120928_230000_Hardball_With_Chris_Matthews,he said he was surprised about how you attacked from every different direction you know as if it was a debateor something he said you weren t very ladylike let s check that thought from him,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,it was a terrorist attack let s be honest about it,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,when it comes to trust though we're watching the hearings on the libya attack and there is no doubt now there is an issue on the trust with the white house and the statements that came out from the various ambassadors and so on what do you make it what it a scandal should heads roll,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well first of all piers president obama knew ambassador chris stevens knew him personally and was s appreciative of his work as president of the united states that diplomat core works for him and he nominates those ambassadors so what we need to do when the united states has been attacked when the americans have been killed while serving our country we don t need to have mitt romney and the republicans in congress taking their first instinct being to take cheap political shots,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,it must have been known after four or five days that it was much more likely to have been a terrorist attack that it wouldhave been planned,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well i think has more information came out the initial information that they had was perceived to be that the attack was the result of protests and as the investigation has worn on which is theresponsible way to deal with it we have come out and the administration has said well it is clear that now it was the result of a terrorist attack but what we don t need to do and what is irresponsible is that my republican colleagues in congress have the first instinct they have had piers is to jump on the cap politic opportunities that they're using this to be instead of closing ranks and saying there has been an attack against americans americans serving our country have been killed we need to get to the bottom of this together and make sure thatwe take steps to prevent this from happening again this is not a political opportunity,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i think you move on from worrying about what mitt romney said and when he said it you re much more concerned if there wasmuch security clearly there was not and secondly with all the mass intelligence in the white house that you have the pentagon and so on why could you make statements four or five days later with completely the wrong information for what has provoked this attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,piers because these investigations are complicated and detailed and rather than say absolutely nothing rather than not give information to the american people ambassador rice went out and talked about what they believed to be happening at the time with the information on from the intelligence communitythat she had and as time wore on as responsibly the investigation revealed more details they came back and said no there was a terrorist attack but it is irresponsible wrong for my republican colleagues to be jumping on this as a political opportunity please piers you keep not letting me,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,announcer just one little piece of information and they can open bogus accounts stealing your credit your money and ruining your reputation that s why you need lifelock to relentlessly protect what matters most beeping helping stop crooks before your identity is attacked and now you can have the most comprehensive identity theft protection available today lifelock ultimate so for protection you just can't get anywhere else get lifelock ultimate,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,and the libya situation extraordinary comments that debbie wasserman made it has nothing to do with mitt romney the white house how the president dealt with it it seems not good enough that you can put out whole wrong statements five days after aterror attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,and if you don t know if it is a terrorist attack just saythat we have been struck by terror again and will come down hard again what is wrong withthat position,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,president obama is taking on mitt romney tonight accusinghim of flip flopping on key issues welcome to you both before we go anywhere i want to play this attack regarding the comments on abortion,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121011_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,yesterday militants stopped the van carrying malala yousufzai they asked who she was and they opened fire when they found out who she was she was shot expected to survive taken out of thecountry for treatment nobody knows the damage she has suffered meanwhile a talibanspokesperson took pride in the attack and said if she survives this time remember she won t next time remember this if anybody asks questions about what right the americans had to take on thepeople,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,we're live in the spin room tonight special edition of hannity we saw two very different candidates on the stage tonight a at time desperate president feeling behind tonight and going on the attack even at times very petulant and childish compared to a confident and relaxed mitt rom nee we're going to get aget analysis including john sinunu from the spin room we check in now with frank luntz and his special focus group tonight,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,tonight we're coming to you from the post debate spin room for more on the we head back to a group of undeciding swing state voters very a question for everybody there it's interesting on the economy highest marks for governor romney and they thought on base points here is charles krauthammer made an observation i happen to agree with that is that the governor governor romney went big was not going to get into the back and forth nah nah nah sort of childish games the president seemed desperate and kind of small with these attacks im thinking you re a state senator two years did that bother the focus group at all,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,what about we know there was a video of the state department charlie lamb testified they watched in realtime and knew this wasn t spon tainus and know that the president s 14 days later could not face a terrorist attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,what governor romney did point out is that attacks in libya there are more questions and answers still as a result in ability to give us answer that s prove to be accurate but it's reflective of the broader failures of the policies that is weakness that leading from behind when you send that signal to that region we become a less state and we can see unraveling of the president foreign policy in the middle east as we saw in libya,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,that may be the case i know after the last debate there was reporting in terms of surveys people felt there is if you look ot john creation romney won on all of those things i believe tonight again one of the key things is that every time the american people have seen a mitt romney who is different than portrayed in 30 second attack ads,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121023_030000_Hannity,im trying im trying and there is 14 days after libya we now know there is a video of what happened in benghazi and charleen lamb testified before congress the video is this the american people choose to see it before the election y 14 days after the election couldn t this president mr overseas contingency man call a terrorist attack for what it was,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,three requests were denied from higher headquarters to not only help the ambassador and his team at the consulate but also to send in outside myrtle jennifer griffin reporting that americans under attack on 9 11 in libya asked for help and were denied will it cost president obama the election we ll have a full report brian williams one of the few journalists with access to president obama did not comal the president about libya we will show you what happened there,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,hi im bill o reilly thanks for watching us tonight will libya lose the election for president obama that is the subject of this evening s talking points memo excellent reporting by fox news correspondent jennifer griffin has revealed that during the four hour fire fight in benghazi libya on 9 11 americans under siege from muslim terrorists armed with heavy weapons repeatedly asked for help from the cia shockingly help did not come the agency could have called for air of cover or moved a delta force team to the area it did not also cia officials told former navy seal tyrone woods who was a file mile away from the attack with a small security team not to enter the fire zone mr woods disobeyed the order and tried to rescue ambassador christopher stevens and other americans tyrone woods was killed that day so was the ambassadors his aid sean smith and glen doherty also a navy seal today on the radio program president obama said this i was not personally aware of any requests obviously we have an infrastructure that s set upto manage requests like that we're kind to find out what happens ultimately any time there is a death of an american oversees i want to find out what happened because my most important job as president is keeping the american people safe,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill all right so once again mr obama didn t explain what happened on 9 11 in libya once again he said his administration isinvestigating but so much so much misinformation has been but the out there by the obama administration you would think that six weeks after the attack some kind of clarity could be put forth by the president he doesn t have to do it because the press is not pushing him brian williams one of the few journalists mr obama is talking with had a chance to ask him some tough questions mr williams passed,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,the assessment of your intelligence community as we stand here is that it was a spontaneous terrorist attack were you happy with what you were able to learn as it unfolded it went on for several hours,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill that is the same answer the president has given for weeks nothing new instead of citing some inconsistencies from theadministration about the libyan attack mr williams dropped the subject totally dropped it after one misleading question going on to the bogus women s health issue mr williams implied that american intelligence stands behind the theory that the libyan attack was quote spontaneous that is not a fact but was presented as such by brian williams now talking points is not sniping at either the president nor mr williams but this is one big mess and the national media is not demanding answers nor did governor romney during the foreign policy debate by the way despite that interview with mr obama the factor at 8 00 last night beat the nbc program rock center in total audience which is kind of amazing getting back to libya my view is this muslim terrorists were tracking ambassador stevens they had heavy weapons at the ready and saw an opening to attack in benghazi there is nothing spontaneous about that the cia was caught napping then froze when all hell broke loose apparently not understanding rescue options or what was at stake when the damage and deathbecame fully known the obama administration tried to manage it rather than report it and so chaos developed people like u n ambassador susan rice as well as white house spokesperson jay carney did not assess the situation correctly to the public talking points believes carney and rice were told by the public what to say but by whom that is the question thatbrian williams should have asked because president obama has to know the answer to that it is unconceivable that he doesn t let me repeat if you ask president obama who told ambassador rice and jay carney to tell the world that a stupid videotape launched the attack the president has to answer the question but no one will ask him for my it's incredibly frustrating i sat there waiting for governor romney bob schieffer and now brian williams to ask mr obama a very simple question it wasn t asked going forward the president will most likely avoid the libyan issue entirely and hope the voters don t care one more thing all administrations make mistakes from george washington to abraham lincoln to franklin roosevelt all presidents have presided over screwups just tell the folks the truth mr president tell us what you know and who you are holding responsible for this mess and that s the memo before we get to reaction i want to give you the latest polling because of 10 days until the vote the polls are important rasmussen daily tracking hasmitt romney at 50 president obama at 47 abc news the same 50 for romney the governor leads 51 to 46 in virginia another must win for romney he leads 47 45 according to ounce too poll released yesterday in colorado nbc poll has the race tied at 48 in nevada nbc has obama up by 3 50 to 47 in wisconsin rasmussen now has that race tied at 49 very good news for governor romney who has been running behind in the badger state in new hampshire rasmussen has romney up by 2 50 to 48 finally 2 billion will bespent on the presidential race this year my question are we getting our money s worth next on the run down herald will react to the shocking new libyan situation that report moments away,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,they had nothing in libya except for two unarmed drones which arrived at the scene two and a half hours after the initial attack all right so bearing in mind that division so have you no military state department and cia ambassador is attacked and slain at the consulate the cia has a semi secret annex a mile away this is a totally different facility run by a totally different agency on a totally different mission they hear gunfire at the consulate they request permission to go and help out the embassy personnel at the consulate permission is denied by the krier tyrone woods and several of his brave colleagues go anyway they rescue the survivors at the consulate they bring them back to the cia annex and they bring back steve smith s body also the ambassador aide,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,right now they are back at the cia facility a secret facility remember now they are frantically asking for help help us where there are snipers now shooting at us we have got our laser view finders we can see the attackers out there come send us help they get no help the cia however that s from the military the cia however since this rapid reaction force from tripoli the libyan capital they get to benghazi several hours later that s glen doherty the other navy seal they go after link up with libyan militia they get to the cia annex that s where woods and doherty are killed when a mortar hits it's unclear how sustained the attack was on the annex when the evening progressed but i think that when you put it in that context that the cia was secret and they tried to do things within their own chain of command the state department was totallydifferent from them and the military in europe is refusing to send in any assets because they are not sure what the hell is going on so i think there is a fog of war aspect there is a division,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,three things number one there is a legitimate scandal on why there wasn t more security for the ambassador in benghazi why the intelligence failed to predict that this militia was going to carry out a deadly attack that s one scandal then there is the attack itself i think it's going to be very very difficult to argue that they have you they have sent ine marines or done a drone strike during the course of the attack,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121027_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,the obama supporters that you talked to did they who do they hold accountable for the skyrocketing gas prices opec congress rich bankers the oil companies ceos a lot of the other people blame everybody i think what the guy hit it right on the head he said a lot of people in congress they don t drive cars they get picked up in town cars they don t have to whip out their credit card and see the sticker shock there hasn t been outcry from either party the republicans have a tendency to be pro business they are not going to attack the oil companies the democrats want wind and green energy,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120911_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i do what it takes after what happened september 11th and being the anniversary so soon as a nation it's something we can't forget i always like to think once you put your guard down that s when people attack that s when things happen it's so important for us to stay awa awake,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,they have not it was taking so long to gept permission to go to tripoli the fbi deployed their personnel to a location in the region so they would be closer they have conducted interviews of the state department and government personnel in libya at the time of the attack they have gotten as far as tripoli but never gotten to benghazi they made a request that the crime scene be secured as we know from public reporting the state department we don t know whether or not the state department put that request though libyans and whether or not it was denied or what happened to it what we know for sure is the crime scene was never secured and the senior law enforcement official i spoke to said if we get there now it is not clear it will be of any use to us the third and critical and astonishing point to me is one of the things we have to do is question the individuals the libyans have in custody to get to the bottom of this and understand what they are learning in fact they made that request with from the state department that was denied by libya so the fbi has to pass questions from the state department to the libyan government they put the questions and you wait like a child s game of telephone the information to come back before you can follow up not the ideal way to run an investigation,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,it is outrageous in the sense that lib kwla is obviously on the edge but i have seen the fbi after an attack like this we're right on the scene i was secured by state department security officers or U.S. military the fbi got right in checked what was missing checked the weapons and everything else that was used in the take i have never seen this since the takeover of our embassy inteheran in 79 it tells me again that libya is a precarious situation the state department realizes that the fbi cannot fight its way in to a crime scene the fbi has got to be secured when it arrives on the ground and there s obviously none the libyans are not cooperating if they are not letting the fbi talk to the people they have arrested and frankly i think those people are probably the types the usual suspects they have nothing to do with the attack but that s just my opinion this is an investigation that cannot possibly at this point turn up very much useful,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,not at all it is the libyans they can't decide which side they are on this is an attack on U.S. soil it was an act of aggression and if they can't tell us who did it why and where these people are that they in fact arrested than the libyan government is on the wrong side,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,mr lake you broke the story in the daily beast that administration officials knew almost immediately that this was a terror attack you say they knew within 24 hours,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,it was largely the intelligence community that collected a lot of information that pointed to al qaeda but they were able to point the location of one of the attackersn part because the person used social media there were a number of clues if you will that were outside of the intelligence community ayman al zawahri the head of ail kie ta congratulated them for getting vengeance against one of the key jihadists who he asked them to get vengeance on the date of the attack is another thing in addition to that there was intelligence coming in and four attackers were identified within 24 hours,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,eli intelligences sources say they located one attacker using social media did they know his exact location,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,yes i would say as the story was coming ouft in the aftermath of the attacks people actually approached me and began kind of telling me what i would call the unauthorized version of events,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,law enforcement sources said to me from day one we knew it was a terrorist attack and we are mystified by why the seniors in the administration have not been clear about that the other thing is when you look at why hasn t this crime scene been secured after all we know the militias and libyan government were in benghazi they were capable of doing it it underscores why has this investigation been handled mishandled and so differently from every other international,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,let me play devil s advocate to give the administration benefit of the doubt or point of argument if intelligence community knew within 24 hours it was a terror attack is it possible administration officials didn twant to say that for security e investigative reason or they wanted to make sure in the fog of battle often intelligence is wrong in the first few hours,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120927_050000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that may i think the last explanation anderson that you offer is the most likely this is an administration they have been burned by putting early information out there where they stepped from it and looked foolish it may be they didn t want to say that the problem with that explanation is when the director of the counterterrorism center says it is a terrorist attack the administration is very slow even up to yesterday when the president s address to the u n general assembly slow to embrace this that it is a terror attack despite the fact you can't keep pointing to the film and protest when they show up with rpgs and mortars,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121121_090000_The_OReilly_Factor,well there is too many news organizations for me to make a broad generalization so let me say this before israel s counter offensive last week hamas lobbed between 750 and 800 missiles into civilian places in israel that s a the love missiles 800 in one calendar year just this year up to 800 missiles but that was never a big news story in the united states im not saying they never covered it but it was never a big running news story it only became a story when israel launched this major counter offensive now why is this i think it's because there is a fascination on the part of liberal journalists and actually liberals in general fascination and an attraction towards the underdog they love the underdog they sympathize with the underdog and if the under dog has brown skin better yet so they see the palestinians as the underdog and israel as the oppressors a lot of the far left and that s why we get stories about uncle mahmoud who was killed in the terrible savage attack by israel and we get incredibly dumb questions like the one you just played from the woman,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120904_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,my advice is the reality is all these hundreds of millions of dollars of negative ads by obama the most vicious campaign i have observed has driven up his unfavorables now here at the convention im sure this is going to happen is he going to have a chance to talk directly to the american people and show the american people what a good and decent person he is and what a fine family he has and that the qualities of the guy look he and i had a tough primary in 2000 2008 as you know i got to like and respect mitt romney i think that part of him has been damaged by this hundreds of millions of dollars of negative attack ads on him which i don t think is going to work at the end of the day that s his challenge i think at the convention and im confident he will will do it,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120904_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,that is correct but that is because of this incredible attack campaigns he has faced im also confident is he doing that but now the eyes of america will be on him when he speaks and i think it's a great idea to have ann romney speaking first that will rebut a lot of the stuff that you have seen this plummets depths i have not seen before in any political campaign,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121101_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know you would expect in a disaster this big that a president would be standing alongside and directing storm response with the governor from the state most affected by the disaster i mean generically speaking this sort of appearance is not a remarkable concept this thing becomes remarkable though to see president obama and chris christie standing together and praising one another and talking about the ways they are working together and seeing their coordinated state and federal disasters this sort of thing becomes remarkable today only because president obama is a democrat and chris christie is a republican and chris christie specifically is a republican who has been a very caustic partisan critic of president obama in his role as a campaign surrogate for mitt romney who president obama is running against in a presidential election that ends in six days mitt romney and that campaign today that campaign that chris christie has been supporting they made a somewhat remarkable decision to go ahead and keep campaigning today to get back on the campaign trail and start doing partisan campaign rallies again even while the president was still suspending his own schedule so he could respond to the storm so what we saw today in split screen was president obama departing the white house en route to storm ravaged new jersey after he stopped in at fema headquarters and at the same time mitt romney in full on campaign mode in tampa florida and then it was president obama touring coastal new jersey and comforting victims of hurricane sandy while mitt romney was holding what he called a big victory rally outside miami and while the romney campaign made sure to have their most telegenic staffers say on camera today that they were going to avoid any partisan commentary today out of respect for the storm victims they said they were going to avoid any partisan attacks on president obama on this very serious day they said they would do that but they apparently really did not mean it because at a rally in wisconsin today they had the republican party chairman talking about how america needs to fire barack obama and saying that the battle to defeat president obama is a battle for this country s freedom at a rally with mitt romney in florida today they had that state s former republican governor jeb bush talking about president obama as a failure his failure to bring this country together at the same event we had a republican state congressman tell parents that they should threaten to take halloween candy away from any children of obama supporters that they know tonight he suggested it i think the idea was he said that obama is a redistributionist and so you can scare kids and their obama supporting parents about redistribution if you steal the kids candy that was the tenor of the romney campaign today even as they told the press corps that they were going to be very respectful and nonpartisan and refrain from attacking the president today it was just a remarkable remarkable day a remarkable decision i mean president obama is expected to restart his campaign schedule tomorrow but mr romney did not want to wait for that he started his campaign events today im sorry are you stuck doing something else i ll take advantage of that i ll get back on the campaign trail im heading to florida apparently you re otherwise occupied well im not it's remarkable it is a remarkable decision to restart his campaign today but honestly it is also remarkable that mr romney never really stopped campaigning in the first place we reported yesterday on this event that mr romney held in dayton ohio yesterday afternoon it was the event that had previously been billed as a victory rally in dayton with the president off the campaign trail entirely to deal with the crisis the romney campaign realized it would be coarse to keep campaigning the campaign s communications director put out a statement on monday saying that the romney campaign was going to be canceling all campaign events out of sensitivity to the millions of americans in the path of hurricane sandy see they realized like they had to seem like they were being sensitive to the crisis but they really really wanted to hold that rally in dayton so what do you do how do you promise to cancel your political rallies in order to seem sensitive but then hold your rallies anyway well in the case of dayton yesterday and mitt romney they held the same event at the same time in the same venue with the same celebrity and they showed the same vote for mitt romney campaign video from the republican convention but they just changed the name of the event they called it a storm relief event instead of calling it a victory rally the one thing they changed materially about the campaign rally in order to make people call it a storm relief event is that they asked people to bring canned goods and groceries as donations to the red cross one of the problems with this as we talked about on last night s show is that that s not actually the right way to donate to the red cross i mean the desire to give groceries and canned goods at the time of a natural disaster comes from the right place it is a nice impulse but unless you re specifically requested by relief agencies or public officials to do that donating canned goods and groceries is just not logistically helpful s on a large scale and from across country especially if you are a presidential candidate getting national press implicitly telling the whole country this is the way to help this is what everybody ought to be doing im not just giving you my opinion on this this is explicitly what the red cross says about donations on their website they make clear under their frequently asked questions on their website that while they are grateful for any kind of thing people want to help they don t actually except donations like that the way you actually can help them is to donate blood or donate money of course having mitt romney do a photo op where people handed him money people handed him checks probably would not make as good a photo op as people handing him bags of cans so the romney campaign set up a photo op where people could hand him bags of cans buzz feed reporter mckay coffins was at that event and added some important detail today to how it all went down amazing story apparently the campaign was worried that people would not bring enough canned and stuff to donate and that would mess up their planned photo op of mitt romney carrying canned goods so quoting buzz feed the night before the event campaign aides went to a local walmart and spent 5 000 on granola bars canned foods and diapers as supporters lined up to greet the romney a young volunteer stood saying you need a donation to get in line one woman asked what if we dropped our donations off up front the volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate and said just grab something two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each and got in line when it was their turn they handed their quote donations to mr romney he took them smiled and offered an earnest thank you to be clear the romney campaign held their campaign rally kaup called it a storm relief event they bought donations for the red cross and then they handed those donations to their own supporters in order to photograph them handing them back to mitt romney so it would look like he inspired generous donations from those people that he actually did not inspire and if they had bothered to check with the red cross they actually don t want and they certainly don t want it modeled as national behavior as for what the red cross want again the red cross for the record does not want your cans they want your money and your blood donation if you do actually want to help i don t know what it looks like in a photo op but you can text the word red cross to 90999 that will give a 10 to the red cross that you will see appear on your phone bill you can do that right now as you are watching this show text 90999 the

attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121020_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,well i think we spent too much money on the military i mean particularly the united states spend half a trillion dollars or more now and what are we getting for it what did we gain by the war in iraq what a disaster the war in afghanistan a disaster the war in pakistan a disaster the war in vietnam a disaster we don t even know who wins and who loses the last time anybody surrendered was japan in 1945 nobody else has surrendered just war is a waste of time and effort and it's consuming far too many of our resources particularly here in the united states our military budget is bigger than the whole rest of the world s budget put together and you know there really isn t a threat that warrants that but the military industrial complex is so entrenched so strong now that none of the none of the congressional candidates have attacked the military budget it's it's it's suicidal to do it,1

this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to help people stick it out despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline im thankful for foreign correspondents and news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on constant stream of short declarative factual statements declaring basic details of the president s movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart like everything she does im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t sites like eclecta blog in michigan and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael

election day is 22 days away three weeks from tomorrow but today was election day for at least one resident of the great state of illinois first lady michelle obama posing with her absentee ballot shortly before posting this photo the first lady tweeted hey barack obama i just dropped my absentee ballot in the mail i couldn t wait for election day love you what she s doing here is a form of voting that s typically more popular among republicans for example in florida in 2008 republicans enjoyed a 17 point edge among people who chose to boat voet by mail 17 points this year one of the early signs in this election that democratsare excited about is at least in florida democrats seem to be closing the gap with absentee ballot mail in voters democrats were still able to win but this year in florida democrats have slunk down the republican advantage on absentee ballot voters from 17 points to just 4 points remember they were still able to win with the 17 point gap last time around so this this has democrats very excited and it has the first lady doing her big voter photo op today now the other way to vote ahead of election day is not to mail in your ballot but to vote early in person and while michelle obama announced she was voting by mail president obama announced today that he is going to be voting early and in person he will be voting on october 25th which would be next thursday that form of vote iing in perso early voting has traditionallyleaned more democratic it year it appears to be following that trend look at this headline from yesterday obama grabs wide lead among those who have already voted but the numbers are amazing president obama leads mitt romney by 28 points among early voters it should be noted that the romney campaign has been complaining about it and trying to discredit it today mitt romney s political director released a memo attacking the medology methodo calling this flawed and untrue nobody complains about the methodology when they are ahead the romney folks have only recently stopped complaining about the methodology of all of the polling being done their complaining stopped when romney started doing better in the polls a couple weeks ago in terms of the swing states this is how things look president obama in pennsylvania with a 4 point lead the president down three points in just the span of a couple weeks in ohio president obama up by 5 points in a poll released over the weekend in florida it's mitt romney up by 1 point in north carolina in virginia romney by 1 point in iowa the latest poll shows the race to be tied a new usa today gallup poll of the swing states shows mitt romney with an overall 4 point lead in the swing states combined just as the romney campaign is complaining about the methodology of the poll of early voters that shows president obama with a nearly 30 point margin among early voters now it's the obama campaign s turn to complain for the first time about the methodology in this new swing state poll the chief pollster releasing amemo attacking this usa today gallup poll as unsound whatever you think about the methodology you can see why the obama campaign would be worried about a poll like this if other polls bare out thismargin in swing states specifically that would imply there s been a change in the race in mr romney s favor right now though that poll does sort of stick out it's an outliar in terms of being more favorable to romney than everything else with polls like this at the combined state level all of the national polls released today show the race is essentially a dead heat tracking shows romney up by 2 the rasmussen poll has romney up by 1 investors business daily has the race at a tie and the new abc news washington post poll shows obama up by 3 here s where it gets interesting a ton of polling stuff comes out every day every day there s at least one super interesting thing and right now the thing most important i think most intriguing in the data out ofall the snapshots of the race is this this right here is probably the most interesting thing abc news and washington post polled voters nape didn t just ask who do they like they asked which candidate would be better on a series of issues here s what they found on the issue of the economy it's president obama by 4 taxes president obama by 5 handling health care obama by 6 handling international affairs obama by 10 handling a major crisis obama by 12 medicare obama by 15 the only issue where the president loses is this one the issue of dealing with the deficit where it's mitt romney holding a 3 point lead over president obama the president leading on every other issue it's because of the ning that lost president obama the first presidential debate two weeks ago which was him trying to explain how mitt romney can't be trusted on the deficit by trying to do the math for everyone live on tv saying something that sounded in translation like you have a large number with a trillion in it and some smaller trillions that when you add them up you subtract and get a number that s positive do you follow me president obama during thatfirst debate was trying to do the math over and over and over again as a way of explaining that what mr romney is proposing would be a recipe for massive deficits really there is no way you can do the things mr romney says he s going to do without running up massive deficits instead of making up memorable arguments that made him the more likely and effective of the two debaters president obama instead tried to prove that thing about the math president obama tried to explain what s so wrong with thinking that mitt romney is a guy who should be taken seriously on the deficit he was trying to explain that without a white board sound track without a

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121114_090000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,in 1942 the federal bureau of investigation broke into the offices of a group called the american youth congress 1942 american youth congress was a progressive group at a time when that could get you branded a communist and hauled before government officials to defend yourself at the time the american youth congress was concerned with questions like why young americans were being drafted into war at age 18 even though for every other legal thing in the country people were not considered to have full rights of citizenship until they turned 21 when the fbi broke into their offices in 1942 they went looking for correspondence they had with one specific notorious anti american revolutionary of the day the first lady eleanor roosevelt known for being an advocate for youth and causes including youth congress the demand for report on eleanor roosevelt s dealings with that group came directly from the director of the fbi j edgar hoover one of the more notable examples of our top law enforcement agency being used to gather potentially politically damaging potentially embarrassing but hardly criminal information about public figures but it was not of course the last instance of that decades later we're still wrestling with the legacy of j edgar hoover and the fiefdom he made of the fbi he kept extensive files he called official and confidential files there were secret documents that tracked the lives of famous and powerful people including details about those peoples lives that were not criminal but would have been embarrassing to those famous people if they became known he kept these special files in his office out of the mainstream of fbi business away from the criminal investigations that were supposed to be what the fbi was doing he kept those secret files because the secrets they contained gave him power and as such they were not suited to any law enforcement purpose but to his needs and that s called abuse of power we now know from released hoover files that he wire tapped president john f kennedy we know he told president kennedy he was aware of an extramarital affair he was having and then he told the president which chicago mobster his mistress was also visiting as civil rights unfolded he wire tapped martin luther king junior he tracked his personal life including supposedly which day of the week he supposedly met with his mistress apparently it was tuesdays in the secrets of the fbi ronald kessler wrote the agent duly recorded that robert kennedy had gone to visit his suspected extramarital sweetheart marilyn monroe shortly before she died and all these stories might peak the public s interest none criminal in nature each of them gave j edgar hoover power over these public people whose secrets he harvested he used federal law enforcement tactics and resources to gather personal and noncriminal damning information on public people and then lorded it over them to advance his own causes under j edgar hoover the fbi became a free lance agency sometimes used against the president but it was sometimes for hire by the president like when the fbi tapped the phones of reporters that richard nixon didn t like and sometimes the fbi was just used for the sake of j edgar hoover s sad twisted little ends when the fbi yes worked on crime but under hoover the fbi worked on politics too the agency s efforts in the latter undermined everything the nation needed from the fbi on the former that s why congress ordered reforms for the fbi after watergate investigating crime while also secretly playing politics is a combination with a bad outcome that s one of the things we learned from the scandal of the nixon administration and its downfall but also from decades watching j edgar hoover operate last week we learned general david petraeus had an affair the fbi discovered that affair over the summer while it was looking into something else those revelations led to protest from members of congress that they had not been told sooner than last week along with everyone else they wanted to be notified about this ranking democrat on the intelligence committee dianne feinstein says the fbi should have told congress bipartisan republican homeland security committee calms alerting congress in an instance like this the fbi s obligation lawmakers are sure to demand answers for why they were not told what the fbi knew as soon as the fbi knew it they're sure to demand answers about that later this week when house officials are called to testify about the attack on our consulate in benghazi we're still wondering whether or not david petraeus will be called to testify too the story about petraeus is quite another thing one is a matter of national and international importance the other appears to be unfortunate end of a decorated military career the cratering of one guy s family life maybe one woman s family life too mindful of the legacy of j edgar hoover the fbi kept the embarrassing personal details of david petraeus private life separate from the question of whether he broke the law we are all human we would all like to know about the affair petraeus has become the must see soap opera of the national week now that the election is over and the new congress begins it is way more gripping than the inaptly named fiscal cliff it is more important to the press from senators to members of congress to little old me and you we would all like to know more about the petraeus scandal

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121130_020000_Hannity,those bombings in 1998 resulted in the loss of life of 12 americans as well as many other foreign nationals and 4 000 people were injured and what troubles me so much is the benghazi attack in many ways echoed the attacks on those embassies in 1998 when susan rice was head of the african region for our state department in both cases the ambassador begged for additional security the ambassador to kenya sent repeated messages to the state department requesting a stronger facility because of the increased threat and those requests as in the case of benghazi were turned down by the state department i asked ambassador rice what her role was she said she would have to refresh her memory but that she was not involved directly in turning down the requests but surely given her position as the assistant secretary for african affairs she had to be aware of the general threat assessment and of the ambassador s repeated requests for more security,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121130_020000_Hannity,sean the senator is absolutely right the comparisons they are eerily similar here s why back in september prudence bushnell the former U.S. ambassador to kenya at the time of the 98 bombings penned an op ed in the new york times in reaction to the benghazi attack she wrote we must make that work safer the reasons change but the human effects are the same for two years before we were blown up in nairobi kenya my team and i thought nagged was the word the state department colleagues used to have security threats and vulnerablallities assessed i was told there was no more money for a more secure embassy just to make sure everyone is following this let s recap this back in the late 90s those in the kenyan embassy were begging the state department for additional security before the bombings but not given additional resources does this sound familiar it gets worse after the attacks in 98 susan rice was put out by the administration at the time to go on pbs and talk about the attack we have the tape watch what she says very closely,0

this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered oen the election effort on either side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to stick it out to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect headlines im thankful for news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark noer at cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on twitter stream showing the president s movements and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that have caused millions of people to look at cancer differently in a way that is unpatronizing and very smart im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporter who is work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t like ohio capital blog in ohio for rarting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120928_040000_Hannity,this is under investigation the unrest around the region has been in response to this video we were not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating than attack on the U.S. mission in banghazi was planned or imminent,0

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20120928_040000_Hannity,well i think it's because they have this narrative that they defeated al qaeda that al qaeda was no longer a really big threat they never say the words islamic fundamentalist terrorism they want to wish it away the president was moving on to asia he was going to declare this a great victory for himself unfortunately this terrible act of terror intervened in their convenient narrative this isn t stupidity sean i said this a while back and got heavily attacked for it i spent a lot of time investigating cover ups and conspiracies this is a cover up it's a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth from an administration that claimed they wanted to be the most transparent in history it's the worst kind of cover up a cover up that involves our national security a cover up that involves the slaughter of four americans and maybe if they had been straightforward about this from the very beginning maybe they could have quelled some of these demonstrations that took place afterwards that also did a tremendous amount of damage,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,this is the thing a lot of conservatives wanted mitt romney to take the lead on he didn t do well tonight he just there was a time line that case he could have made he didn t do it well and the president did refer to an act of terrorism on the day after attacks also administration then went on for days and days talking about this movie including aum the way up to the president s appearance at un so romney did not make the case as well as he could have and i think that the viewer who s haven t followed it came away with a muddled impression,0
attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_080000_The_OReilly_Factor,yes i agree with byron i think the fact that romney flubbed the initial answer or that he was corrected by the president then again by candy crowley this is a highly debatable point seems to get him off stride the problem i think bigger problem for the administration is that this is an issue that is now likely to dominate the debate just as did it coming out of the vice presidential debate that is something the white house and obama campaign cannot be happy b now we're back candy crowley as i understand walked back for correction of mitt romney and said on a broader point he was correct and the administration was blaming this on the video we're back into thisdiscussion about the time line what happened when why administration was talking about the video not about a terrorist attack that is something that the white house can't be happy about,0

2004 campaign that john kerry versus george w bush campaign in the spring of that your photos surfaced that showed something going horribly wrong in one of the bush wars photos from an american run prison in iraq called abu graib they showed the prisoners being mistreated horribly and bizarrely sexual humiliation obvious physical abuse sexual assault prisoners being menaced by dogs obscene and medieval and americans who were doing it ultimately 11 soldiers were charged and convicted they were demoted but that was it donald rumsfeld stayed bush got re elected the war wentont for another seven years before we got a president who ended it as much as we may have just decided to move on from all that and consign it to the way we think of the bush era which is over there has been all these years one element of abu ghraib that could not really just be over and it was this these are army reservists we have blurred both faces but army reservists on the top of the screen army reservists prosecuted posing with a dead man the same man appears a few different times in the photo dossier from abu ghraib he got described as the iceman in the descriptions of the photos because his body was packed in ice in the picture but he had a name this is his widow and his son holding the same picture he was killed in U.S. custody military autopsy ruled his death a homicide the justice department announced this year they had reviewed about 100 cases of people abused or tortures by american personnel abroad and decided they would not prosecute anyone but they saved out two specific cases for full criminal investigation two cases where people in custody were killed one was a prisoner who died while shackled half naked to the wall of a freezing cold cell in afghanistan and one what mr mr aljamadi of everything that happened in the bush years they tried to push down the memory hole these were the two cases the murders that were held out as maybe worthy of prosecution 100 cases no prosecutions but these two okay maybe we ll look at those no last week on the last day of the republican national convention when mitt romney was busy not mentioning the war in afghanistan at all the justice department announced that day they would not prosecute anybody for those last two cases either the new york times editorialized any remaining hope for meaningful accountability and torture has ended for all practical purposes that s it the last two cases it's over as of thursday and then all of a sudden it wasn t over anymore yesterday a week after the justice department said that chapter in our history is over yesterday the book opened back up this is a drawing of a box a three foot by three foot box that a libyan man says he was locked inside by the cia in afghanistan three feet by three feet think about about that he and another man he and another man say that they were hung from a handcuffs inside this box that they ve drawn there would have been multiple people in this one in each stall that is barely wide muff for a man s body these drawings were published today by spencer ackerman at wired com the two circles you see in one of the stalls are speakers on either sides of the men whowould be suspended in boxes speakers blaring loud music directly into their ears a new report by human rights watch says that the man who describes having been locked inside the first cramped box was also waterboarded by americans in 2003 in afghanistan a whole new allegation of waterboarding we never knew about before the cia only admits to doing water boarding to three people and this new guy is not one of the ones they admit to the cia is denying his claims we ve never prosecuted any of this not even the murders we keep trying to put it behind us but it keeps coming back president obama on his first full day in office banned torture by U.S. personnel it is already illegal to torture are somebody and it was supposed to be banned but we did torture people during the bush administration so banning it after that administration meant rescinding all the ho couple pseudolegal advice that bush people used to supposedly justify it and protect people from prosecution the president made it no longer the policy of the united states to torture but his administration also decided to let the people who did torture get away with it and the man he is running against for president now says that he would happily reinstate the old bush era policies on torturing people on waterboarding prosecutions for torture would have made this a latter of law and justice and negativity policy not prosecuting it makes it just another policy issue just another choice between candidates just another choice that any president can make moving forward because there is a precedent of it being known in this country and unprosecuted in this country and therefore effectively legalized which means as long ago and as far as away as 2004 seems from this year and this election the american people have another choice to make in this election between torturing people or not that is still not a settled matter for us as a nation it's just a decision made by one man

an important part of their decision also 9 of those voting yesterday said their decision was made at the last minute and the storm was fresh in everybody s mind but sandy did not directly reelect president obama hispanic americans did breaking 71 for the president despite all of that mitt romney could have won the election had he recaptured momentum last weekend it's like a sporting event the team with the mo in the last few minutes of the game usually wins but the romney campaign did nothing zero nothing in the last few days to jump start the governor local campaigning is never enough if mitt romney had a guy as smart as obama s chief strategist david axelrod the governor would be celebrating tonight talking points believes that by not emerging aggressively after sandy romney cost himself the presidency and if the election had been held 8 days earlier the governor would have defeated barack obama now going forward some folks are despairing today mike ballinger who lives in west hartford connecticut wrote we have lost our american way of life there is some truth to what mike believes dennis miller has a similar take coming up but the truth is the U.S. a is a rapidly changing country and the republic party has to rethink strategy in hindsight senator marco rubio would have been the best choice to run with mitt romney it's not a knock on congressman paul ryan he did very well it's just that the g o p knees to send a powerful signal to g o p voters that respect them they cast approximately 11 million ballots yesterday obama beat romney by less than 3 million in the popular vote the good news for the republics is that the pressure is now on president obama and the democrats if the economy doesn t improve dramatically over the next four years the democratic party will evaporate simple as that what is more complicated is the mind set of the american people as i reported last night during the election coverage about half of all american homes are now receiving some kind of government entitlement some earned some not so any effort to reform or cut back on entitlements is a tough sell but it's going to have to be done president obama won because he effectively put together a coalition of the willing voters who had something to gain by keeping him in office but with the nation heading towards financial insolvency possible bankruptcy that kind of where s mine attitude will bring economic ruin if mitt romney had forcefully made that case he might have prevailed this year it was not enough to say what you would do to defeat the obama machine you had to convince voters danger in the president s policies mitt romney could not convince enough independent voters of that the governor needed to overwhelm the electorate with points of doom because they are real he needed to bring an urgency to his presentation he did not preferring to campaign the old fashioned way by the way stock market tanked today down 313 points in response to the vote wall street worried about obama economics going forward as far as moving the republic party further into the conservative precincts the numbers simply aren t there exit polling found that 35 of voters described themselves as conservative right now 25 liberal 41 moderate so while the right is still powerful ideology is not going to win the national election any longer the president is indeed a liberal guy but he ran as a populist who wants to give working americans a break his acolytes pushed the far left nonsense he didn t however behind the scenes mr obama embraced just about every far left cause that is cause for concern because in his final term only the house of representatives stands between barack obama and a far left ideological administration thank god for that check and balance on a personal note americans who voted for mitt romney are understandably disappointed tonight but should accept the situation setting themselves up as the loyal opposition that s the way it's always been in america i believe things happen for a reason and that fate swings hard and in unexpected ways president obama won fair and square to use a cliche and we should all respect the vote what s very important to me is that you whom im sworn to look out for were satisfied with the factor s election coverage about 40 000 of you voted in our bill o reilly com poll and 80 believe we were fair while 20 dissent i will read some of those dissenting letters at the end of the broadcast even more impressive was that more than 7 million americans watched this program the factor on monday evening the night before the vote by far the largest audience of any prime time news program the reason we tell it straight may not agree with me on everything but what we do here is fair bold and sometimes fresh and not beholden to anyone and that s the way elections should be covered and that s the memo up ahead tonight morris goldberg miller and beckel we're coming right back,1

months todd akin was heavily favored in that race after those comments in the latest polling he is down by six in the days following the debut of mr akin s fake science theory about rape and pregnancy republicans were tripping all over each other in a rush to condemn him or calling on him to drop out of the race and why you can see why no one would want to be associated with what todd akin said here is an important thing about everybody calling on him to get out of the race and condemning him on the republican side absolutely zero of these national republican candidates calling on him to get out of the race were going to been the same ballot with todd akin this year todd akin is running a state wide race in missouri be that means he s on the ballot in missouri and nowhere else so while it makes sense for republicans it makes sense for them to be saying please don t think of me when you think of that todd akin guy republicans in those other states are never going to share the ballot with todd akin this fall right republicans todd akin problem is not that bad he is only on the ballot in missouri but now republicans have a mitt romney problem and a mitt romney problem is national his problem holds true for every republican candidate in every race across the country in november from dog catcher up to senator every republican who s running for office shares a ballot and shares an r next to their name with mitt romney this year and mitt romney as you know has spent the last couple of days to try to find a more elegant way to call 47 of the country the working poor and the young people and the elderly in this country trying to find a more elegant way to call them irresponsible and entitled more elegant than he said it in his secretly recorded comments in a room full of 50 000 a plate donors when he said that his campaign was not having trying to connect with the 47 of american who is dot annoy pay income taxes and who he therefore sees as dependent and victims and not responsible citizens and you can see the political effect of the mitt romney problem already even 47 days from the election as mr romney has been dropping in the polls so have been republican senate candidates just nomonth just during the calendar month of september the focus at real clear politics have moved three races further out of republican race the wisconsin senate race which they had considered a republican leaning race is now considered a toss up between tommy thompson and tammy baldwin both ohio and michigan which previously had been rated by real clear politics as toss ups those have both been moved both ohio and michigan have been moved into the leans democratic column after mostly running neck and neck for months polling out of virginia this week shows democrat tim kaine seven points ahead of george allen although that s not that that s not the right that s not never mind there we go after months of polling mostly behind republican senator scott brown in massachusetts elizabeth warren is up by five points in the latest poll out there this week it's the fourth straight poll showing her in the lead and in connecticut after bri briefbrie briefly ceding the polls mcmahon is back in the lead this week as well if it were worth it for republicans to flee from todd akin with whom they are not sharing a ballot it is definitely worth it for the same republicans the to apparently flee from mitt romney republican strategists warning in the hill newspaper today that the mitt romney s fumbling campaign could cost republicans in a number of down ballot races one strategist working on senate races saying quote if romney doesn t improve that could cost us our chance of picking up the senate for sure honestly i don t know who s driving the train but they need to get their message focused and we are now seeing some of those candidates who stand to maybe lose an otherwise close ranks thanks to mitt romney calling half the country a bunch of lazy moocher bums we are seeing those senate candidates flee from mr romney and his rhetoric at least on this issue republican senator scott brown in massachusetts saying that mr romney s vision of 47 of americans as dependent and entitled is quote not the way i view the world senator dean heller running for re election in a tough race in nevada likewise saying he does not view the world the same way mitt romney does linda mcmahon the wrestling mogul who is running for senate in connecticut she says she disagrees with mr romney mark meadows running for congress as a republican in north carolina says that he is different from mitt romney lamontagne running in new hampshire promising not to be a partisan is promising not to be a partisan governor in the style of mr romney and his 47 speech but here s maybe the biggest panic button that there is on the republican side right now it's from the huffington post today a republican operative working on congressional races quote warned that in key swing states mitt romney s support and internal polling is well below that of republican candidates in districts where the presidential nominee needs to get big support to have a chance at winning this is the quote from therepublican operative he is just well under all of our other guys this republican said im very concerned think about what that means for a second what they're talking about here is key districts in key swing states ones where mitt romney really needs to win big in order to win that swing state and mr romney is underperforming the other republicans who are going to be on the ballot in those areas these are the places where mr romney needs to do great and in the internal republican polling in those places he is doing awful and that speaks very poorly of his chances of carrying those swing states but more ominously for the republican party it means that the lower level candidates who are running for congress in those districts are now having their own races endangered by virtue of the fact that they share a ballot with a man named mitt romney safe republican districts are getting less safe because mitt romney is going to be on the ballot in those races too how are republicans going to solve this problem how are they going to solve this problem the answer to that question is the answer to who comes out ahead in this area s electionsand how they

republicans were supposed to retake control of the senate this year a sure bet they were only defending ten seats and the democrats were defending 23 that s a tilted playing field like this not only did the republicans not retake the senate the democrats held on to control and increased their margins that s impossible that is an impossible republican failure in a year like this and the depth of that failure is bottomless look at how they failed the more astonishing it is how badly they failed not only did mitt romney lose the presidency but in terms of losing republican senate candidates in 11 states the republican senate candidates did even worse with voters than mitt romney did in those states mitt romney who lost the country said no to mitt romney this week but they said oh no no no no to republican senate candidates it was just a catastrophe from north dakota to florida and everywhere in between who was to blame for that that is not an esoteric matter there is a named person in charge of making sure republicans win senate seats there was somebody who was in charge of that for every election and that specific person in this election obviously failed catastrophically that specific person is named john cornyn today the republican party appears ready to respond to his atrocious failure at this job this week by giving mr cornyn a promotion he s getting a reward for nearly shooting the moon in the senate for doing as bad as humanly possible at the last job the republican party gave him the republican party moving forward apparently would like him to be the number two republican in the whole senate right behind mitch mcconnell and that is calling failing up which is amazing on its own terms in terms of republicans in the senate i think we also should wonder if that is instructive for how the republican party is going to deal with the overall question of who their leader is and what they stand for after this electoral drubbing they took in this week s election the washington post reporting today that the republican party is going to undertake a big internal review of what went wrong on tuesday reportedly take place over the next few weeks and months spearheaded by republican party national officials the goal of the review is to determine quote what went so wrong and how to fix it good idea yeah let s review it's a good idea because the informal process so far of the right trying to figure out what went wrong for republicans this election that informal process so far is not going well republicans have so far decided that hurricane sandy is the reason mitt romney lost they have also decided that fact checking is the reason mitt romney lost karl rove said it's democratic voter suppression is the reason mitt romney lost really there was also a satirical blog post a piece of comedy written about military votes not being counted and that got parts of the right very excited today that that was the reason that mitt romney lost until they realized that that blog post was satire the republican effort so far to diagnose what went wrong on tuesday why mitt romney lost that effort has not gone very well take conservative columnists in the washington post today he took a stab at diagnosing what ails the republicans now specifically he assessed why the republican party has an issue with women voters this was his assessment quote the problem here for republicans is not policy but delicacy speaking about culturally sensitive and philosophically complex issues with reflection and prudence republicans don t have a policy problem when it comes to women s issues in other words they just speak about their policy preferences on women s issues with insufficient delicacy women don t mind that this is how republicans are governing with respect to women s rights they just like to hear that their rights are being repealed in more flowery prose i mean the diagnosis is that republicans should just find a more delicate way to describe things like mandatory medically unnecessary transvaginal ultrasounds at the order of bob mcdonnell you can say that more softly you can say it in cursive if you want to but it's probably still going to bring tens of thousands of protesters outen the streets to line your walk of shame into the building from which you were trying to govern that way in ohio mitt romney lost women by 11 points he lost the state and the presidency since republicans are telling themselves that the gender gap has nothing to do with policy you want to know what ohio republicans have done since the election on tuesday ohio republicans today said they're going to reintroduce their bill from last session to ban almost all abortions in ohio that should take care of your problem with women voters republican party right now finds itself at a cross roads once again in the year 2000 we knew george w bush s choice of vice president dick cheney would never himself run for president he s not healthy enough not young enough not popular enough we knew 12 years ago that george w bush was coming into office with no heir apparent with no obvious successor since the end of george w bush s two terms in office the most interesting thing in american politics has been watching the republican party trying to figure out who their leader would be post george w bush we knew it would never be dick cheney it did not end up being john mccain it definitely did not end up being sarah palin for awhile it looked like it would be michael steele when they picked him to run the party maybe no how about john boehner speaker of the house previous republican house speakers have been able to fashion that job into a national leadership role but john boehner has not done that i mean no disrespect but nobody thinks of him as the leader of the republican party mitt romney did have that job mitt romney for awhile was the leader of the republican party we can prove it with evidence this past june president obama walked out into the rose garden and announced he was going to stop the deportation of kids who were here without papers through no fault of their own when president obama announced that beltway reporters immediately went to the republican leaders in congress to see what s the official response from that what s the official republican position on that issue here s what the reporters were told by the republicans in congress senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday that gop lawmakers will wait for mitt romney to take the lead on immigration policy quote most of our members are interested in what governor romney has to say about this issue and we're going to withhold judgment most of us until that time mr romney was not just the de facto leader of the republican party he was the stated leader of the republican party now that he s lost the presidency obviously nobody thinks that mitt romney going forward is going to continue to play the role of leader of the republican party the boston globe reported that mr romney is likely to move to la jolla california to spend more time with his car presumably but in his short time as leader of the republican party when he was their presidential nominee he made leadership decisions about the party about what the party s like about what the party looks like to the rest of the country he made leadership decisions particularly in terms of who he would dignify with his embrace who among everybody in the republican party he mitt romney leader of the party would privilege who he would elevate he elevated guys like chris cobach the republican guy who wrote arizona s papers please immigration law he was mitt romney s immigration adviser he made and then kept as his national campaign chairman a man named john sununu who called president obama lazy and not very bright and said president obama needs to quote learn how to be an american mitt romney s national campaign chairman mr romney also elevated and dignified by his presence im sorry to have to say the name but this guy donald trump mitt romney as the leader of the republican party as their presidential standardbearer flew out to las vegas to bernly receive donald trump s endorsement mr romney s running mate paul ryan held special in person events with donald trump he did robocalls throughout the campaign and he wasn t freelancing mitt romney asked him to do it he did have the leadership reins of the republican party for a brief moment as their presidential candidate and what he did with that position of leadership is going to haunt the republican party prospects of being taken seriously for a long time to come so the question now as it has been for many years now is who s next who runs that party who is their leader now how could a luminous

a sunday show you say you have so many questions about and after a personal more than an hour long closed door meeting just for you who you run nothing but just for you just to answer your personal questions one on one face to face with those two officials all you can say i have so many questions suspe isn t it starting to seem no matter what answers they are given no matter what access they are given they are going to keep saying they have more questions here s one possibility about what maybe is really going on here fwhak 2004 a guy named mitt romney was the governor of the state of massachusetts if you don t remember who that is he was a private equity guy from massachusetts back in 2004 he was in the middle of his one and only term as governor the nominee for president was a senator from the same state john kerry of massachusetts if he had won the presidential election that year his senate seat would have become open so the governor of massachusetts the republican mitt romney would have been able to appoint somebody to fill john kerry s senate seat the mts legislature totally dominated by democrats was cognizant that the governor would probably pick a republican to fill the seat if kerry got elected president so the massachusetts state legislature decide d to change the law they changed the law so that only a special election could fill a vacant seat until then the seat would have to be empty mitt romney tried to veto that new law but the legislature overrode his veto thereby stripping mitt romney of his power to choose a replacement that became a mute point because john kerry didn t win so he stayed on as senator but then fast forward fife years 2009 new president barack obama the country embroiled in a big debate over national health reform those against it were against it to the point of rage and those wo who wanted it were excited to be on the cusp of achieving something they had failed to achieve for decades at the time the democrat hs a majority in the united states senate 60 seats is a filibuster super majority that s enough to pass health reform that majority for the democrats included senator ted kennedy senator kennedy spent his career trying to pass health reform it was his life s work he had done it at the state level with that guy mitt romney he had led on the issue nationally for decades it was his signature issue but before he was able to see health reform finally signed into law senator ted kennedy lost his life to brain cancer he died in august of 2009 when ted kennedy died that meant that his seat did become empty in massachusetts and the democrats no longer had their 60 vote super majority chrks they needed to pass health care they were short one vote knowing this might happen and this is really dramatic knowing that this might happen that might turn out this way before he died senator ted kennedy took a dramatic step to plan for the future of the health reform law he had worked for his whole life this health reform law that his death might make impossible to pass thinking about the affect that his death might have on the prospect of passing health reform senator kennedy wrote a letter before he died urging that the governor of massachusetts be allowed to fill an empty senate seat if one were to open up and with mitt romney gone the massachusetts senate legislature agreed so they changed the rules again so the new democratic governor this man could fill ted kennedy s seat with an interim office holder until a international election could be held thereby restoring with this interim office holder the democrat s 60 vote margin so at the last minute with that assist from the recently departed champion of health reform the democrats filled his seat with an interim senator and they squeaked the health reform bill through with zero republican votes and president obama signed it into law and now everybody calls it obama care even the democrats call it obama care and they mean that in a good way but then in the meantime there was the small matter of the special election to elect somebody to take over the full remaining portion of senator kennedy s term it was a strange election to permanently fill ted kennedy s seat there was one race on the ballot the turnout was very low it took place amid a right wing backlash to the democrats passing health reform tea party money and republican money from all over the country poured into the state of massachusetts and this unknown guy who happened to be a republican won that special election in january 2010 the next time massachusetts got a chance to reconsider that vote for scott brown was two and a half years later and in that election massachusetts frankly ree investigatored to form and picked the democrat they picked elizabeth warren to oust scott brown from that senate seat he held for less than a term the elizabeth warren scott brown race was pretty close by massachusetts standards the margin in the senate race this election had the democrat winning by eight points which sounds like a lot in a normal state that would be a lot but in the presidential race the democrat won the presidential race by a heck of a lot more than 8 points the democrat won by 23 points and that is a fairly normal margin by which democrats beat republicans in the state of massachusetts so given that scott brown losing by only eight can be considered kind of a victory it's at least pretty close and after that loss that scott brown loss and than credibly expensive and hard fought race immediately thereafter republicans wanted to talk about how to get scott brown back to washington and now today to them it seems so close they can taste it because although john kerry is still a senator from massachusetts after his very high profile role in the obama campaign and speaking gig at the democratic national convention after that john kerry s name was put forward as one possibility a leading possibility to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state that of course would result in him leaving his senate seat after all which would mean there would be a temporary ae re placement appointed and then there would have to be another special election to fill the rest of his term where scott brown would be the republican nominee again which would be the best chance of putting a republican in the senate any time soon which is why republicans got so excited when john kerry s name was floated his name was floated along with one other name for that job republican senators were very very quick to point out that they really prefer john kerry to be the nominee for secretary of state a ringing endorsement for john kerry from republicans in washington because if john kerry becomes secretary of state there s going to be a special election for a senate seat and there would be this chance that scott brown could be back in washington so the republicans say emphatically and repeatedly and to any reporter that will listen we prefer john kerry over susan rice for this job please if john kerry doesn t get secretary of state and he s maybe going to get secretary of defense instead i say woe be unto any feasible rival for that gig somebody who might get that cabinet position ahead of him too which republicans would please like to happen and you know what maybe this is nuts maybe this is nuts maybe this is why to simplistic but maybe this makes more sense than the contention we're supposed to believe which is that two active investigations multiple briefings a statement from the president a statement from the u n ambassador a closed door one on one meeting with that ambassador and with the director of the cia have not given john mccain enough opportunity to ask whatever questions he wants to ask about remarks made on a sunday morning talk show two and a half months ago maybe this makes more sense than that joining us is somebody more level headed andrea mitchell host of andrea

this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to help people stick it out despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline im thankful for foreign correspondents and news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on constant stream of short declarative factual statements declaring basic details of the president s movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart like everything she does im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t sites like eclecta blog in michigan and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan mccain who we ve been able to bring on board officially here at this network but also everybody else on the right who was willing to come on just as a guest because you are not afraid to leave the echo chamber i will not say your name here for fear it will get all your christmas party invitations rescinded from your friends on the right but you know who you are and i thank you and i hope there are more of you next year im thankful for c span im thankful for the election that we just went through and im thankful that it is over and that it really really really i swear it really is too soon to start talking about 2016 for a long time it will be too soon to talk about 2016 i am thankful for that and for the fact that through this flawed and contested but ultimately noble system of regular elections and representative democracy what we have in this country are peaceful transitions of power i am thankful for all of that and you know what i am thankful for the fact that the highest profile person in our entire country other than our president is our nation s top diplomat with tonight s cease fire in the middle east i am very very thankful for diplomacy american diplomacy and just diplomacy we have more on that just ahead live from the middle east there is a lot to be thankful for this thanksgiving eve including the fact that ours is a country that makes a

trip to the clinic to get his blood tested but not anymore bob s doctor recommended a different option once a day xarelto xarelto is the first and only once a day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem that doesn t require routine blood monitoring like warfarin xarelto is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib related stroke there is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed no routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes new zealand xarelto is just one pill a day taken with the evening meal and with no dietary restrictions bob can eat the healthy foods he likes do not stop taking xarelto rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding like unusual bruising or tingling you may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto with aspirin products nsaids or blood thinners talk to your doctor before taking xarelto if you currently have abnormal bleeding xarelto can cause bleeding which can be serious and rarely may lead to death you are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto and it may take longer for bleeding to stop tell your doctors you are taking xarelto before any planned medical or dental procedures before starting xarelto tell your doctor about any conditions such as kidney liver or bleeding problems ready to change your routine ask your doctor about once a day xarelto for more information

the kind of rum to make a daquari this is better than the mezcal list that s two legally even though one of the two mezcals apparently has illegal as its brand name this is all you can legally get as far as it goes mezcal in the state of utah however if you have a kind of rum or a kind of mezcal or even a label of wine that you would like to be able to get but that isn t on the utah state list you can request it from the state government if you click on the little shopping cart there on the website it takes you to the special orders page where you can ask your state government to please buy you some better mezcal or whatever you have to ask them though they do try to be helpful they're a whole section of the state government s website about how to best pair the wines of the state of utah with various types of food this is not like a tourism thing this is not an export things or wines made in utah it's wines from everywhere but the state has to get them for you used to be a state employee in utah whose job it was to taste every alcohol and wine and whiskey the state was considering allowing into the state to be sold i don t know if there is someone with that job but it wasn t that long ago that s because in utah the department of alcoholic beverage control is not only tasked with enforcing liquor laws in the state giving out licenses they choose which wines and beers and spirits the citizens of the state of utah may purchase the state government on behalf of its residents tastes wine and decides if it is good enough for utah whether did the states deal with booze is really weird i always thought it's because we had a long strange national failed experiment called prohibition that was not that long ago when prohibition ended in 1933 americans could legally buy and sell and drink booze for the first time in 13 years people were obviously psyched when prohibition ended but there was a the lot of policy to figure out how to sell and regulate alcohol would cities do it would states do it the federal government do you need a license to sell alcohol how old to drink alcohol states came up with their own answers to those questions and the laws between the states all these decades later are diverse today for example 18 states are called control states which means they control the wholesale and retail sales of alcohol that s why in a controlled state like utah the state chooses your wines for you and hopefully we will help you pair them with dinner maryland is not a control state but there s one county in the state montgomery county that does it that way too le a little taste of utah in the middle of maryland it isn t just between places that have state stores for booze and states that don t have state stores i mean in some places you can buy beer or wine or hard stuff at the rite aid or gas station in some places you can buy beer at a gags station but spirits come from a state store that looks like a prison there are all the different levels of control on the sale and distribution of booze up to and including the state becoming the retailer that sells you the booze now that is about to happen with pot too sort of three states had wide ranging new rules about pot the on the ballot this year not about medical marijuana but recreationalal use of marijuana it passed in washington and colorado but not in oregon which is oregon is a more blue state than colorado is oregon was voting on something slightly different the model of the state run store that sells all the liquor in the state than utah that is what oregon was considering for pot the state would regulate people growing and processing pot and getting it ready to be sold in oregon the proposal was that the state itself would buy all of the pot in the state and then sell that pot to oregon residents presumably at stores that look like prisons like with whiskey in north carolina and utah and a bunch of other states too that model of how to deal with legalized pot is what was rejected in oregon this year but what was accepted in colorado and washington state on the other hand was a proposal that those states should license and regulate people to grow marijuana license and regulate people to process it and prepare it for sale then in colorado and washington what they said is that the state should also regulate normal businesses private for profit stores to operate like regular liquor stores like regular businesses selling this new illegal product regulated and taxed by the state that is the proposal that won by ten points in colorado and by 12 points in washington state according to these ballot initiatives it will not be illegal to buy or possess less than an ounce poft over the age of 21 on paper it's that pot is regulated much like alcohol is but the really important difference is the really important difference is that according to the federal government and therefore for the whole united states of america everywhere according to the federal government it's illegal to buy or sell pot that s just as much the law as these new state laws that say the opposite what s going to happen here is it legal or not is it going to be legal to buy and sell and smoke pot in colorado and washington or is it not we are not the only ones asking this question the people in charge are asking the question too the governor of colorado has indicated he also has no idea how this is going to work on election day he put out a state reminding coloradans under federal law pot is still ellegal so they should hold off on the cheat toes and goldfish for the time being they met with the deputy attorney general to figure out how this will be handles meanwhile prosecutors in the two largest counties in washington state have taken matters into their own hands they have dropped hundreds of cases of pot possession in that state hundreds of criminal cases have been dropped the king county prosecutor says there s no point in continuing to seek criminal penalties for conduct that will be legal next month true enough however in the same state out in the eastern part of washington state and spokane county prosecutors there say they plan to keep arresting people just as they do now for pot related offenses their argument in spokane is the only legal way to get pot in washington even after this new state law goes into effect will be to buy that pot from a state regulated pot store and those state regulated pot stores don t exist yet but they might soon be created if the federal government allows that to happen and nobody knows that the government will allow them to happen this is policy soup and i don t mean this as a munchies joke this doesn t make any sense yet joining us for the interview is neil frank linn he served in law

these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered oen the election effort on either side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to stick it out to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect headlines im thankful for news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark noer at cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on twitter stream showing the president s movements and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that have caused millions of people to look at cancer differently in a way that is unpatronizing and very smart im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporter who is work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t like ohio capital blog in ohio for rarting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan mccain who we ve been able to bring on board officially here at this network but also everybody else on the right who was willing to come on just as a guest because you are not afraid to leave the echo chamber i will not say your name here for fear it will get all your christmas party invitations rescinded from your friends on the right but you know who you are and i thank you im thankful for c span im thankful for the election that we just went through and im thankful that it is over and that it really really really i swear it really is too soon to start talking about 2016 for a long time it will be too soon to talk about 2016 i am thankful for that and for the fact that through this flawed and contested but ultimately noble system of regular elections and representative democracy what we have in this country are peaceful transitions of power i am thankful for all of that and you know what i am thankful for the fact that the highest profile person in our entire country other than our president is our nation s top diplomat with tonight s cease fire in the middle east i am very very thankful for diplomacy american diplomacy and just diplomacy we have more on that just ahead live from the middle

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121101_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know you would expect in a disaster this big that a president would be standing alongside and directing storm response with the governor from the state most affected by the disaster i mean generically speaking this sort of appearance is not a remarkable concept this thing becomes remarkable though to see president obama and chris christie standing together and praising one another and talking about the ways they are working together and seeing their coordinated state and federal disasters this sort of thing becomes remarkable today only because president obama is a democrat and chris christie is a republican and chris christie specifically is a republican who has been a very caustic partisan critic of president obama in his role as a campaign surrogate for mitt romney who president obama is running against in a presidential election that ends in six days mitt romney and that campaign today that campaign that chris christie has been supporting they made a somewhat remarkable decision to go ahead and keep campaigning today to get back on the campaign trail and start doing partisan campaign rallies again even while the president was still suspending his own schedule so he could respond to the storm so what we saw today in split screen was president obama departing the white house en route to storm ravaged new jersey after he stopped in at fema headquarters and at the same time mitt romney in full on campaign mode in tampa florida and then it was president obama touring coastal new jersey and comforting victims of hurricane sandy while mitt romney was holding what he called a big victory rally outside miami and while the romney campaign made sure to have their most telegenic staffers say on camera today that they were going to avoid any partisan commentary today out of respect for the storm victims they said they were going to avoid any partisan attacks on president obama on this very serious day they said they would do that but they apparently really did not mean it because at a rally in wisconsin today they had the republican party chairman talking about how america needs to fire barack obama and saying that the battle to defeat president obama is a battle for this country s freedom at a rally with mitt romney in florida today they had that state s former republican governor jeb bush talking about president obama as a failure his failure to bring this country together at the same event we had a republican state congressman tell parents that they should threaten to take halloween candy away from any children of obama supporters that they know tonight he suggested it i think the idea was he said that obama is a redistributionist and so you can scare kids and their obama supporting parents about redistribution if you steal the kids candy that was the tenor of the romney campaign today even as they told the press corps that they were going to be very respectful and nonpartisan and refrain from attacking the president today it was just a remarkable remarkable day a remarkable decision i mean president obama is expected to restart his campaign schedule tomorrow but mr romney did not want to wait for that he started his campaign events today im sorry are you stuck doing something else i ll take advantage of that i ll get back on the campaign trail im heading to florida apparently you re otherwise occupied well im not it's remarkable it is a remarkable decision to restart his campaign today but honestly it is also remarkable that mr romney never really stopped campaigning in the first place we reported yesterday on this event that mr romney held in dayton ohio yesterday afternoon it was the event that had previously been billed as a victory rally in dayton with the president off the campaign trail entirely to deal with the crisis the romney campaign realized it would be coarse to keep campaigning the campaign s communications director put out a statement on monday saying that the romney campaign was going to be canceling all campaign events out of sensitivity to the millions of americans in the path of hurricane sandy see they realized like they had to seem like they were being sensitive to the crisis but they really really wanted to hold that rally in dayton so what do you do how do you promise to cancel your political rallies in order to seem sensitive but then hold your rallies anyway well in the case of dayton yesterday and mitt romney they held the same event at the same time in the same venue with the same celebrity and they showed the same vote for mitt romney campaign video from the republican convention but they just changed the name of the event they called it a storm relief event instead of calling it a victory rally the one thing they changed materially about the campaign rally in order to make people call it a storm relief event is that they asked people to bring canned goods and groceries as donations to the red cross one of the problems with this as we talked about on last night s show is that that s not actually the right way to donate to the red cross i mean the desire to give groceries and canned goods at the time of a natural disaster comes from the right place it is a nice impulse but unless you re specifically requested by relief agencies or public officials to do that donating canned goods and groceries is just not logistically helpful s on a large scale and from across country especially if you are a presidential candidate getting national press implicitly telling the whole country this is the way to help this is what everybody ought to be doing im not just giving you my opinion on this this is explicitly what the red cross says about donations on their website they make clear under their frequently asked questions on their website that while they are grateful for any kind of thing people want to help they don t actually except donations like that the way you actually can help them is to donate blood or donate money of course having mitt romney do a photo op where people handed him money people handed him checks probably would not make as good a photo op as people handing him bags of cans so the romney campaign set up a photo op where people could hand him bags of cans buzz feed reporter mckay coffins was at that event and added some important detail today to how it all went down amazing story apparently the campaign was worried that people would not bring enough canned and stuff to donate and that would mess up their planned photo op of mitt romney carrying canned goods so quoting buzz feed the night before the event campaign aides went to a local walmart and spent 5 000 on granola bars canned foods and diapers as supporters lined up to greet the romney a young volunteer stood saying you need a donation to get in line one woman asked what if we dropped our donations off up front the volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate and said just grab something two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each and got in line when it was their turn they handed their quote donations to mr romney he took them smiled and offered an earnest thank you to be clear the romney campaign held their campaign rally kaup called it a storm relief event they bought donations for the red cross and then they handed those donations to their own supporters in order to photograph them handing them back to mitt romney so it would look like he inspired generous donations from those people that he actually did not inspire and if they had bothered to check with the red cross they actually don t want and they certainly don t want it modeled as national behavior as for what the red cross want again the red cross for the record does not want your cans they want your money and your blood donation if you do actually want to help i don t know what it looks like in a photo op but you can text the word red cross to 90999 that will give a 10 to the red cross that you will see appear on your phone bill you can do that right now as you are watching this show text 90999 the word red cross and that actually will help you can go to redcross org and donate through their website and you can donate blood at a blood drive in your local hometown this is a real disaster this is not a plot in a sitcom about how to run for president this is a real disaster an ongoing affecting millions of americans and real help really is needed and that is not the same thing as using the suffering of millions of americans as an occasion to accrue political capital for yourself by trying to create the appearance that you are helping when you are not bothering to actually try to really help that is something very different,1

evening s talking points memo over the thanksgiving weekend i was down in austin in houston texas doing shows with miller it's been a while since i had visited the lone star state and i took a good look around next week i will be going tout to california the state with the largest population texas is second fascinating to compare the two places because they signify the clash the clash that s taking place in america right now texas voted for romney by about 1 3 million votes california voted for obama by about 2 3 million votes texas conservative state california dominated by liberal americans both states have more minority voters than white voters the overriding tradition of texas is that self reliance rules most voters there don t want government telling them what to do therefore they don t have a lot of social service no state income tax in texas however get in the lone star state about 40 billion there is a balanced budget amendment by contrast california owes an astounding 167 billion and it's running an annual deficit of about 9 billion money they that can never never be paid back what is california getting for all of that high school graduation rate 37 out of 50 states per capita income 44 500 but there is a 10 1 unemployment rate crime number one there are more prisoners in california than any other state take a look at texas high school graduation rate ranks 44th slightly above california per capita income about 40 000 bucks per year but there is relatively low unemployment 6 6 convicts in state prisoners ranked number two behind california so you can see there is not a big difference in the economic and social stats but there is a big difference in mind set california has many more social welfare programs golden state also has many more business regulations texas you could pretty much set up any bigness you want you can also ride a motorcycle without a helmet talk on the cell phone without a car and on and on texans basically saying hey government get out of our lives californians on the other hand generally embrace big government in just about all areas i mean when the city council of san francisco proposes to ban gold fish you know you have intrusive situation same city council finally banned publicity nudity last week except for permitted festivals or parades thank god the thanksgiving day parade not held in the city by the bay in texas if you run around naked and make a wrong move you might get shot the state allows its citizens to carry concealed weapons can't do that if you are naked in california only vicious drug cartel people carry guns because if the regular folks do likely be big trouble get in big trouble when the cartel guys go back to mexico can you see there is a stark difference between living in texas and living in california the question for all americans is what place do you think is better i like both states they are fascinating i don t want to live in a nanny state that s what california is new york is getting there as well where i live california is also going bankrupt 167 billion in debt are you kidding me that is grossly irresponsible for a state with as many natural resources as california i mean these pinheads in sacramento think they can just spend money and other people have to pick up the tab meantime in texas if you hit it big you get to keep much of what you earn yes there are local taxes but the state does not impose an income tax that s why so many workers are moving to the lone star state florida is a situation there comes a point where etch auto of us has to decide what kind of country we want many americans are depressed because traditional america seems to be disappearing certainly president obama is a big government progressive guy and now he has a second term talking points doesn t expect the president to change his philosophy is he going to spend enormous amount of money on social justice and he is going to take money from successful americans in in order to finance his vision could be wrong but i don t believe that s going to help the economy very much however the president is going to do the social justice thing no matter what in texas the government does not believe that redistributing income is its responsibility all does not believe that you should micromanage the lives of its citizens if you are dumb enough to ride a motorcycle without a mel helmet and you wind up in a cemetery it's your call trust me nobody is banning 16 ounce soft drinks in waco again it goes back to everybody has a gun in california and the federal government if koop after if california and the federal government keep spending the way it's been spending both will go bankrupt before they leave office very true tax scheme bubbling under the surface so called wealth tax in france spain iceland switzerland they taxed net word of wealthy people every year doesn t matter if you earn anything or you get income or dividends doesn t matter if you have assets house gold car whatever those governments are going to take some of that uber liberals in america want to do the same thing,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121124_110000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,i am thankful that the president made a nate silver joke when he pardoned the thanksgiving turkeys cobbler and gobbler this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to help people stick it out despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline im thankful for foreign correspondents and news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on constant stream of short declarative factual statements declaring basic details of the president s movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart like everything she does im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t sites like eclecta blog in michigan and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan mccain who we ve been able to bring on board officially here at this network but also everybody else on the right who was willing to come on just as a guest because you are not afraid to leave the echo chamber i will not say your name here for fear it will get all your christmas party invitations rescinded from your friends on the right but you know who you are and i thank you and i hope there are more of you next year im thankful for c span im thankful for the election that we just went through and im thankful that it is over and that it really really really i swear it really is too soon to start talking about 2016 for a long time it will be too soon to talk about 2016 i am thankful for that and for the fact that through this flawed and contested but ultimately noble system of regular elections and representative democracy what we have in this country are peaceful transitions of power i am thankful for all of that and you know what i am thankful for the fact that the highest profile person in our entire country other than our president is our nation s top diplomat with tonight s cease fire in the middle east i am very very thankful for diplomacy american

is now in the process of challenging the eligibility of nearly 800 000 voters in the swing state of ohio we ll have more on that in just a second that s the good news for the romney campaign today and it may be all the good news they can get on day when everything else is against them as it's been since the campaign started we're at a point where some errors cannot be reversed each day s news cycle can be decisive each day on out some voters are voting people are casting their vote for president by mail north carolina is first this year in terms of allows that are residents to vote the hill reporting today that several hundred north carolina ballots have been returned to local elections officials there voters in indiana and kentucky will start to get their ballots which means that people can start voting in those states as well while the headlines about the mitt romney for president campaign looked like this politico inside the campaign how mitt romney stumbled the new york times the amid discord romney seeks to sharpen message the mill republican lawmakers say romney campaign need to change course romney in panic mode romney campaign in disarray says romney campaign more from politico mitt romney abruptly shifts strategy blogs bounce on mitt romney s stumbles the washington post the romney campaign is in trouble it's not like the mitt romney campaign didn t look like it was in trouble before today but what s driving this overwhelmly vicious news cycle for them is now people who work on the campaign are talking to reporters most notably in that politico story they are talking about each other and about mitt romney explaining who it is that they pl blame for the fact they are losing now one saying i also have this impression stewart must save his best stuff for meetings im not important enough to attend the campaign is filled with people who spend their time avoiding him or resisting him then there s the criticism of the candidate they are baffled that a successful corporate leader has created a team with so few lines of authority or accountability you expect a little of this from political professionals when their campaign is running behind but you do not expect the candidate himself to get attacked by his staffers who are still working as his staffers and you do not expect so much of the fire to be trained on the top guy in the campaign who is not being fired he s being kept in place is this just the kind of thing that happens in every campaign is this a nonsubstantive process freak out being driven by the press or is this real they make it seems like he s losing the election pbadly looking at the data looking at the fundamentals is usually a better way to grasp be longer view than looking at one day of headlines in one tough news cycle look at this here is the swing state and the maybe swing state now here is the latest polling that we have from the last few days in new hampshire president obama leading by five points in virginia president obama leading by five points in north carolina it's mitt romney by six points in florida it's president obama with a two point lead in pennsylvania president obamawith an 11 point lead and in ohio by seven points and in wisconsin mr obama by two points and in colorado it's mr obama with one point and in nevada the president leading by three points are you noticing a trend in terms of the issues which voters are deciding the race those look good for the president a brand new new york times cbs poll shows that president obama is erasing mitt romney s edgewhen it comes to who voters trust more on the committee among latino voters mr romney was at 26 then he went up to 30 after the republican convention he s now back down to 26 president obama has a 42 point lead among latino voters when you look at the biggest possible picture president obama is now up by three points nationally you look at all those things together you can understand why people who want president obama to be reelected are feeling like things are going their way if you want to be realistic not just gut check but a well informed perspective of what s going on here there s one dynamic and two numbers that you need to sort of get your head around the dynamic is those polls say when thing when you look at them as a snapshot but it makes more sense to look at them in motion and how they are changing over time and look at the trends they represent the poll has president obama leading by threepoints but over the past few days the number has shrunk it was six points and now it's three points he s still got a lead but it's contracting not expanding that s the dynamic at work now in the gallup poll the first number is about money we reported that mitt romney and the republicans raised more money month of may than obama and the democrats did romney and the republicans did that in june and in july in august they did not do that they did not president obama and the democrats out raised mitt romney and the republicans in august which was an unexpected development and one that made obama supporters feel very good nbc news today looked at the data of what money is being spent and by whom and it turns out that most of the money that is being spent to try to elect mitt romney president is not basic spent by mitt romney s campaign or by the republicans most of the money that s being spent to elect mitt romney is being spent by outside groups most of what is being spent for mitt romney is outside money most of the outside money overall in the whole country is pro romney here is the number look 75 75 of it is pro romney money 75 compare the campaigns but don t miss the big picture if you believe that money makes a difference as to who wins elections that is bottomless mostly untraceable money from deep pocketed donors who can give infinitely again and again when they are giving 775 of that money is pro romney one last number getting real about this it's the number i mentioned at the top of this segment 730 000 a tea party linked group called the ohio voter integrity project says it will challenge the eligibility of 730 000 registered voters in ohio nearly one out of every ten voters in ohio is going to have their registration challenged the cincinnati enquirer reporting on how the group has been testing the waters by trying to get voters thrown off the rolls the group says that nationwide they're moving statewide against more than 700 000 people in ohio to keep them from voting today was probably the worst day ever in terms of press and in terms of panic in the mitt romney campaign that was all before david corn and mother jones and huffington posted the visdeo saying that 4 of the government is dependent on government and looking for hand out because

hit,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121127_040000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill im bill o reilly thanks for watching us tonight a tale of two americans california and texas that is the subject of this evening s talking points memo over the thanksgiving weekend i was down in austin in houston texas doing shows with miller it's been a while since i had visited the lone star state and i took a good look around next week i will be going tout to california the state with the largest population texas is second fascinating to compare the two places because they signify the clash the clash that s taking place in america right now texas voted for romney by about 1 3 million votes california voted for obama by about 2 3 million votes texas conservative state california dominated by liberal americans both states have more minority voters than white voters the overriding tradition of texas is that self reliance rules most voters there don t want government telling them what to do therefore they don t have a lot of social service no state income tax in texas however get in the lone star state about 40 billion there is a balanced budget amendment by contrast california owes an astounding 167 billion and it's running an annual deficit of about 9 billion money they that can never never be paid back what is california getting for all of that high school graduation rate 37 out of 50 states per capita income 44 500 but there is a 10 1 unemployment rate crime number one there are more prisoners in california than any other state take a look at texas high school graduation rate ranks 44th slightly above california per capita income about 40 000 bucks per year but there is relatively low unemployment 6 6 convicts in state prisoners ranked number two behind california so you can see there is not a big difference in the economic and social stats but there is a big difference in mind set california has many more social welfare programs golden state also has many more business regulations texas you could pretty much set up any bigness you want you can also ride a motorcycle without a helmet talk on the cell phone without a car and on and on texans basically saying hey government get out of our lives californians on the other hand generally embrace big government in just about all areas i mean when the city council of san francisco proposes to ban gold fish you know you have intrusive situation same city council finally banned publicity nudity last week except for permitted festivals or parades thank god the thanksgiving day parade not held in the city by the bay in texas if you run around naked and make a wrong move you might get shot the state allows its citizens to carry concealed weapons can't do that if you are naked in california only vicious drug cartel people carry guns because if the regular folks do likely be big trouble get in big trouble when the cartel guys go back to mexico can you see there is a stark difference between living in texas and living in california the question for all americans is what place do you think is better i like both states they are fascinating i don t want to live in a nanny state that s what california is new york is getting there as well where i live california is also going bankrupt 167 billion in debt are you kidding me that is grossly irresponsible for a state with as many natural resources as california i mean these pinheads in sacramento think they can just spend money and other people have to pick up the tab meantime in texas if you hit it big you get to keep much of what you earn yes there are local taxes but the state does not impose an income tax that s why so many workers are moving to the lone star state florida is a situation there comes a point where etch auto of us has to decide what kind of country we want many americans are depressed because traditional america seems to be disappearing certainly president obama is a big government progressive guy and now he has a second term talking points doesn t expect the president to change his philosophy is he going to spend enormous amount of money on social justice and he is going to take money from successful americans in in order to finance his vision could be wrong but i don t believe that s going to help the economy very much however the president is going to do the social justice thing no matter what in texas the government does not believe that redistributing income is its responsibility all does not believe that you should micromanage the lives of its citizens if you are dumb enough to ride a motorcycle without a mel helmet and you wind up in a cemetery it's your call trust me nobody is banning 16 ounce soft drinks in waco again it goes back to everybody has a gun in california and the federal government if koop after if california and the federal government keep spending the way it's been spending both will go bankrupt before they leave office very true tax scheme bubbling under the surface so called wealth tax in france spain iceland switzerland they taxed net word of wealthy people every year doesn t matter if you earn anything or you get income or dividends doesn t matter if you have assets house gold car whatever those governments are going to take some of that uber liberals in america want to do the same thing,1

hit,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120905_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,serving as your first lady is an honor and a privilege but back when we first came together four years ago i still had some concerns about this journey we had started while i believed deeply in my husband s vision for this country and i was certain he would make an extraordinary president like any mother i was worried about what it would mean for our girls if he got that chance how will we keep them grounded under the glare of the national spotlight how would they feel being unrooted from their school their friends and the only home they had ever known see our life before moving to washington was filled with simple joys saturdays at soccer games sundays at grandmother s house and a date night for barack obama and me was either date dinner or a movie because i couldn t stay awake for both and the truth is i loved the life we had built for our girls and i deeply loved the man i had built that life with and i didn t want that to change as he became president i loved barak just the way he was you see even back then when barak was a senator and a presidential candidate to me he was still the guy who picked me up for our dates in a car that was so rusted out i could actually see the pavement going by in a hole in the passenger s side door he was the guy whose proudest possession was a coffee table he had found in a dumpster and whose only pair of decent shoes was a half size too small but see when barak started telling me about his family see now that is when i knew i had found a kindred spirit somebody whose values and upbringing were so much like mine you see barak and i were both raised by families who didn t have much in the way of material possessions but who had given us something far more valuable their unconditional love their unflinching sacrifice and the chance to go places they had never imagined for themselves my father was a pump operator at the city water plant and he was decided with ms when my brother and i were young and even as a kid i knew there were plenty of days when he was in pain and i knew there were plenty of mornings when it was a struggle for him to simply get out of bed but every morning i watched my father wake up with a smile now grab his walker prop his walker slowly shave and button his uniform and when he returned home after a long day s work my brother and i would stand at the top of the stairs in our little apartment patiently waiting to greet him watching as he bent down to lift one leg and the oer to slowly climb his way into our arms but despite these challenges my dad hardly ever missed a day of work he and my mom were determined to give me and my brother the kind of education they could only dream of as i got to know barak i realized that even though he had grown up all the way across the country he had been brought up just like me barak was raised by a single mom who struggled to pay the bills and by grandparents who stepped in when she needed help barak s grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank and she moved quickly up the ranks but like so many women she hit a glass ceiling and for years men no more qualified than she was men she had actually trained were promoted up the ladder ahead of her earning more and more money while barak s family continued to scrape by but day after day she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus arriving at work before anyone else giving her best without complaint or regret and she would often tell barak so long as you kids do well bear that is all that really matters like so many american families our families were not asking for much they didn t begrudge anyone else s success okay that anyone else or they didn t care that anybody else had much more they simply believed in the fundamental american promise that even if you don t start out with much if you work hard and do what you re supposed to do you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids that is how they raised us those are the values that barak and i and so many of you are trying to pass on to our own children that is who we are and standing before you four years ago i knew that i didn t want any of that to change if barak became president well today after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways i never would have imagined i have seen firsthand that being president doesn t change who you are no it reveals who you are are you see i have gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like and i have seen how the issues that come across a president s desk are always the hard ones you know the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer the judgment calls where thestakes are so high and there is no margin for error and as president you will get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people but at the end of the day when it comes time to make that decision as president all you have to guide you are your values and vision and the life experiences that make you who you are so when it comes to re building our economy barak is thinking about folks like my dad and his grandmother he is thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day s work that is why he signed the lilly ledbetter pay act to help women get fair work that is why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet that is how he brought our economy from the edge of collapse to creating jobs again jobs you can raise a family on good jobs right here in the united states of america when it comes to the health of our families barak refused to listen to all of those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day another president he didn t care whether it was theasy thing to do politically no that is not how he was raised he cared that it was the right thing to do he did it because he believes that here in america our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine our kids should be able to see a doctor when they're sick and nobody in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or an illness and he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care that is what my husband stands for when it comes to giving our kids the education they deserve barak knows that like me and like so many of you he never could have attended college without financial aid and believe it or not when we were first married our combined monthly student loan bill was actually higher than our mortgage yeah we were so young so in love and so in debt and that is why barak has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt,1

this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to help people stick it out despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline im thankful for foreign correspondents and news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on constant stream of short declarative factual statements declaring basic details of the president s movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in just a few weeks the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war a parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart like everything she does im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t sites like eclecta blog in michigan and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan mccain who we ve been able to bring on board officially here at this network but also everybody else on the right who was willing to come on just as a guest because you are not

invitation thank you for your extraordinarily warm welcome ann and i appreciate your friendship very very much thank you now al you are right a campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes we blue jeans in the morning perhaps suits for a lunch fund raiser sport coat for dinner but it's nice to finally relax and wear what ann and i wear around the house im glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition of course im pleased that the president s here we were chatting pleasantly this evening as if tuesday night never happened and i credit that of course to the cardinal it's taken new york s highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior i was actually hoping the president would bring joe biden along this evening because he ll laugh at anything of course this isn t a night for serious politics and it was especially nice to see president obama and cardinal dolan sharing the dais despite their differences im sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president s wine turns into water or for that matter whether my water turns into wine im pleased to once again have the chance to see governor cuomo who s already being talked about for higher office a very impressive fellow but he may be getting a little ahead of himself i mean let me get this straight the man has put in one term as a governor he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that s enough to run for president of course we're down to the final months of the president s term as presidents as president obama surveys the waldorf banquet room with everyone in white tie and finery you have to wonder what he s thinking so little time so much to redistribute and don t be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers he knows how to seize the moment this president and already has a compelling new campaign slogan you re better off now than you were four weeks ago you know with or without all the dignitaries that are here the al smith dinner surely lives up to its billing usually when i get invited to gatherings like this it's just to be the designated driver your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the catholic church i have special admiration for the apostle st peter to whom it is said upon this rock i will build my church the story is more inspiring when you consider he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say if you got a church you didn t build that of course only 19 days to go until the finish line campaign full of surprises the debates are very surprising just the other night we had a fun debate candy crowley was there and help to welcome us people seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates let me tell you what i do first refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate second find the biggest available strawman and then just mercilessly attack it big bird didn t even see it coming and by the way and in the spirit of sesame street the president s remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter o and the number 16 trillion campaigns can be a grueling exhausting president obama and i are each very lucky to have one person who s always in our corner someone who we can lean on and someone who s a comforting presence without whom we wouldn t be able to go another day i have my beautiful wife ann he has bill clinton we got a big dose of the biden charm last week i ll tell you that in his debate with paul ryan im not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that joe intended because afterwards i heard from the federal election commission from now on whenever he appears on tv there s a recording of me afterwards that says im mitt romney and i approve this message of course rules of fairness have to be enforced because what other safeguard do we have besides the press and applause now i never suggest that the press is biased i recognize they have their job to do and i have my job to do my job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country and their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it applause let s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things when suddenly i pulled ahead in some of the major polls what was the headline polls show obama leading from behind and i ve already seen early reports from tonight s dinner headline obama embraced by catholics romney dines with rich people applause of course the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church there have been some awkward moments like when the president pulled pope benedict aside to share some advice on how to deal with his critics he said look holy father whatever the problem is just blame it on pope john paul ii of course the president has found a way to take the sting out of the obama care mandates for the church for now on they're going to be in latin we have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me he and i of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest it would be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty but fortunately we don t carry the burden of disliking one another our president has had some very fine and gracious moments don t tell anyone i said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud you can oppose applause in our country you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will and that s how it is for me there s more to life than politics at the al smith foundation and the archdiocese of new york you show this in the work you do in causes that run deeper that allegiance to party or to any contest of the moment no matter which way the political winds are blowing what work goes on day in day out by this organization and you you answer with calm and willing hearts and service to the poor and care for the sick in defense in the rights of conscious and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born you strive to bring god s love into every life applause i don t presume to have all your support and a night like this im certainly not going to ask for it but you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that i stand proudly with you as an ally and friend god bless you all and god bless the united states of america thank you,1

is now in the process of challenging the eligibility of nearly 800 000 voters in the swing state of ohio we ll have more on that in just a second that s the good news for the romney campaign today and it may be all the good news they can get on day when everything else is against them as it's been since the campaign started we're at a point where some errors cannot be reversed each day s news cycle can be decisive each day on out some voters are voting people are casting their vote for president by mail north carolina is first this year in terms of allows that are residents to vote the hill reporting today that several hundred north carolina ballots have been returned to local elections officials there voters in indiana and kentucky will start to get their ballots which means that people can start voting in those states as well while the headlines about the mitt romney for president campaign looked like this politico inside the campaign how mitt romney stumbled the new york times the amid discord romney seeks to sharpen message the mill republican lawmakers say romney campaign need to change course romney in panic mode romney campaign in disarray says romney campaign more from politico mitt romney abruptly shifts strategy blogs bounce on mitt romney s stumbles the washington post the romney campaign is in trouble it's not like the mitt romney campaign didn t look like it was in trouble before today but what s driving this overwhelmly vicious news cycle for them is now people who work on the campaign are talking to reporters most notably in that politico story they are talking about each other and about mitt romney explaining who it is that they pl blame for the fact they are losing now one saying i also have this impression stewart must save his best stuff for meetings im not important enough to attend the campaign is filled with people who spend their time avoiding him or resisting him then there s the criticism of the candidate they are baffled that a successful corporate leader has created a team with so few lines of authority or accountability you expect a little of this from political professionals when their campaign is running behind but you do not expect the candidate himself to get attacked by his staffers who are still working as his staffers and you do not expect so much of the fire to be trained on the top guy in the campaign who is not being fired he s being kept in place is this just the kind of thing that happens in every campaign is this a nonsubstantive process freak out being driven by the press or is this real they make it seems like he s losing the election pbadly looking at the data looking at the fundamentals is usually a better way to grasp be longer view than looking at one day of headlines in one tough news cycle look at this here is the swing state and the maybe swing state now here is the latest polling that we have from the last few days in new hampshire president obama leading by five points in virginia president obama leading by five points in north carolina it's mitt romney by six points in florida it's president obama with a two point lead in pennsylvania president obamawith an 11 point lead and in ohio by seven points and in wisconsin mr obama by two points and in colorado it's mr obama with one point and in nevada the president leading by three points are you noticing a trend in terms of the issues which voters are deciding the race those look good for the president a brand new new york times cbs poll shows that president obama is erasing mitt romney s edgewhen it comes to who voters trust more on the committee among latino voters mr romney was at 26 then he went up to 30 after the republican convention he s now back down to 26 president obama has a 42 point lead among latino voters when you look at the biggest possible picture president obama is now up by three points nationally you look at all those things together you can understand why people who want president obama to be reelected are feeling like things are going their way if you want to be realistic not just gut check but a well informed perspective of what s going on here there s one dynamic and two numbers that you need to sort of get your head around the dynamic is those polls say when thing when you look at them as a snapshot but it makes more sense to look at them in motion and how they are changing over time and look at the trends they represent the poll has president obama leading by threepoints but over the past few days the number has shrunk it was six points and now it's three points he s still got a lead but it's contracting not expanding that s the dynamic at work now in the gallup poll the first number is about money we reported that mitt romney and the republicans raised more money month of may than obama and the democrats did romney and the republicans did that in june and in july in august they did not do that they did not president obama and the democrats out raised mitt romney and the republicans in august which was an unexpected development and one that made obama supporters feel very good nbc news today looked at the data of what money is being spent and by whom and it turns out that most of the money that is being spent to try to elect mitt romney president is not basic spent by mitt romney s campaign or by the republicans most of the money that s being spent to elect mitt romney is being spent by outside groups most of what is being spent for mitt romney is outside money most of the outside money overall in the whole country is pro romney here is the number look 75 75 of it is pro romney money 75 compare the campaigns but don t miss the big picture if you believe that money makes a difference as to who wins elections that is bottomless mostly untraceable money from deep pocketed donors who can give infinitely again and again when they are giving 775 of that money is pro romney one last number getting real about this it's the number i mentioned at the top of this segment 730 000 a tea party linked group called the ohio voter integrity project says it will challenge the eligibility of 730 000 registered voters in ohio nearly one out of every ten voters in ohio is going to have their registration challenged the cincinnati enquirer reporting on how the group has been testing the waters by trying to get voters thrown off the rolls the group says that nationwide they're moving statewide against more than 700 000 people in ohio to keep them from voting today was probably the worst day ever in terms of press and in terms of panic in the mitt romney campaign that was all before david corn and mother jones and huffington posted the visdeo saying that 4 of the government is dependent on government and looking for hand out because they can't be persuaded to vote for anything other than barack obama because they can't be persuaded to,1

this year im thankful that nate silver s professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real of whether numbers can be trusted to be true even when you do not like what the numbers indicate if you are thankful that barack obama was re elected as president i have to say you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re elected as speaker of the house and vice versa if you re psyched about john boehner you re probably not psyched about president obama but there is one thing about the re election of both of these men that i think is maybe worth being thankful for i am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently these two men have been willing to show emotion in public to be big tough american leaders of the highest order right both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters and they are willing to be seen shedding a tear without shame i am thankful for that in our national american leadership i am thankful that the brilliant bbc series house of cards about the most evil politician ever a mini series that i ve watched a million times and i ve been addicted to for years i am happy i am thankful i am thankful that house of cards is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february im thankful for nbc white house producer shauna thomas who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year and we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote even before the long lines on election day itself we could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on and i am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise i am thankful for that and while we're on the subject honestly im thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in those long lines to vote this year im thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting and to help people stick it out despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast im thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties in one state this year it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american particularly on this holiday i am thankful that in 2012 running an overtly race based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points after that campaign regardless of who he is i am thankful that that campaign was a failure i am thankful that the satire site the onion ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal right nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan while reading up on petraeus sex scandal yes yes the onion gets it right again sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could and this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline im thankful for foreign correspondents and news organizations who pay them and pay their expenses which are considerable and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big dangerous world im thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone i am very thankful for that i am thankful specifically for abc s martha raddatz who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season she was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year and she ran a freaking excellent debate and while we are on the subject of people on other networks for whom i am thankful i am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs who i ve never met but whose twitter stream is an always on constant stream of short declarative factual statements declaring basic details of the president s movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on why isn t there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia mark knoller s on it tail winds from japan what was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event mike knoller s on it and it includes yams im thankful that in

have fought in afghanistan i am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self start veteran s cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit im thankful there is still an american automobile industry when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true im thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists but it is kicking butt i am thankful for that im thankful that when my pal xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart like everything she does im thankful for xeni im thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the local abc affiliate in flint michigan he s the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi million dollar ad buys around the country that actually president obama wasn t changing gun laws to take anyone s guns away and then paul ryan pulled off his microphone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over im thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles to cbs atlanta building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama s mind control techniques to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal ridden now former congressman david rivera im thankful specifically for james carter who brought the infamous 47 video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at mother jones magazine and that video of course ended up being a bigger deal even than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter im thankful for reported local politics blogs some of which are partisan and some of which aren t sites like eclecta blog in michigan and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs im thankful for the jackson free press specifically staying on the mississippi voter i d story when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i d story any other way and we couldn t have done it without them im thankful to the miami herald for keeping this great reporter carol rosenberg on the guantanamo beat even when the country has largely turned away from that story carol rosenberg s reporting is definitive and relentless and it is a service to the country that the miami herald has kept her on that beat i am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc and yes that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan mccain who we ve been able to bring on board officially here at this network but also everybody else on the right who was willing to come on just as a guest because you are not

noble system of regular elections and representative democracy what we have in this country are peaceful transitions of power i am thankful for all of that and you know what i am thankful for the fact

hit,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120905_070000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,when president obama entered the white house the economy was in a freefall the auto industry on its back the banks frozen up more than 4 million americans had already lost their jobs and america s bravest our men and women in uniform were fighting for what soon would be the longest war in our history you remember the uncertainty and the fear that seized our country on that first day i said mr president which crisis do you want to tackle first he looked me in the eye with that look he usually reserved just for his chief of staff rahm we were sent here to tackle all of them not choose between them there was no blueprint or how to manual for fixing a global financial meltdown an auto crisis and two wars and a recession all at the same time believe me if it existed i would have found it each crisis was so deep and so dangerous any one of them would have defined another presidency we faced a once in a generation moment in american history and fortunately for all of us we have a once in a generation president and in those uncharted waters i saw when the president finds his north star every night president obama reads ten letters from everyday americans when i met with the president at the end of each day he made sure he had their letters to read at his residence letters from people just hoping for someone in power to understand their struggles i can't tell you how many times whether we were discussing the economy health care or energy crisis the president walked to his desk take out one of the letters and read them to us andsay this is who we are fighting for parents working hard to save for their ild s education middle class americans fighting tooth and nail to hold on to their jobs their homes or their life savings it is their voices that president obama brings to the oval office it is their values i saw him fight for every day in the first month in office he fought for the american recovery act to cut taxes for the middle class to put people to work building america s roads rails and runways and today our economy has gone from losing 800 000 jobs a month to adding four and a half million private sector jobs in the last 29 months thinki bankings banks are lending again in case we forget that was a change we believed in a change we fought for that was the change president obama delivered president obama took office knowing full well that for the last century presidents had tried to reform our health care system today because of president obama s courage kids can stay on their parents s plan until they're 26 insurers can't kick you off your policy because you have a pre because you have hit the pre existing limit they wouldn t be able to deny you because you have a pre existing condition because of president obama s leadership every american will have access to affordable quality health care that was the change we believed in that was the change we fought for that was the change president obama delivered i saw the president make the tough calls in the situation ro room and today our troops in iraq have finally come home so america can do some nation building here at home that was a change we believed in and a change we fought for that was a change president obama delivered i remember when the president received the report that the auto industry had a few weeks before its collapse we met in the roosevelt room late into the night some of the president s advisers said that in order to save general motors you had to let chrysler go under others said it is like throwing good money after bad among all the experts there were only guesses and nobody put it at better than a one in four shot only the president suggested going all in to save the industry and the jobs now the one thing i know with absolute certainty having served two great presidents is that in the next four years an unforeseen crisis challenge or conflict is going to show up and seize this country whose leadership whose judgment whose values do you want in the white house when that crisis lands like a thud on the oval office desk that is right the person who said in four years let detroitgo bankrupt or a president who had another four words not on my watch a person who believes in giving tax cuts to the most fortunate or a president who believes in making college affordable for all americans a person who wanted to keep don t ask don t tell or a president who believes that keeping you from loving the person you love should not happen when the fall of uncertainty surrounds a crisis storms into the white house and all the advisers chiefs of staffs only have guesses to help the president it will be the president s leadership that determines how we as a nation face the challenges that meet the middle class it is the president s values that shape the future in which the middle class has hope the person who takes the oval office in the next four months will shape not only the next four years but the next 40 years in this great nation in this next four years we need proven leadership and proven judgment and values america needs four more years

you did last night michelle on monday night but i know him to state the obvious from a differentperspective i know him and i want to show you i want to show you the character of a leader who had what it took when the american people literally stood on the brink of a new depression a leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years to a future as great as our people i want to take you inside the white house to see the president as i see him every day because i don t see him in sound bites i walk 30 paces down the hall into the oval office and i see him i watch him in action four years ago the middle class was already losing ground and then the bottom fell out the financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people i grew up with you remember the headlines you saw some of them in thepreviews highlight highest job losses in 60 years headlines economy on the brink markets plummet worldwide from the very moment president obama sat behind the desk resolute in the oval office he knew he knew he had not only to restore the confidence of a nation but he had to restore the confidence of the wholeworld and he also knew he also knew that one one false move could bring a run on the banks or a credit collapse to put another several million people out of work america and the world needed a strong president with a steady hand and with the judgment and vision to see us through day after day night after night i sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after the other to stop the slide and reverse it i watched him i watched him stand up i watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous enormo challenges the consequences of which were awesome but most of all i got to see firsthand what drove this man his profound concern for the average american he knew he knew that no matter how tough this decisions he had to make were in that oval office he knew that families all over america sitting at their kitchen tables were literally making decisions for their family that were equally as consequential you know barack and i we ve been through a lot together these four years and we learned about one another a lot about one another and one of the things i learned about barack is the enormity of his heart and i think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him applause and there s another thing another thing that has bound us together these past four years we had a pretty good idea what all those families all you americans in trouble were goingthrough in part because our own families had gone through similarstruggles barack as a young man had to sit at the end of his mother s hospital bed and watch her fight with her insurance company at the very same time she was fighting for her life when i was a young kid in third grade i remember my dad coming up the stairs in my grand pop s house where we were living sitting at the end of my bed and saying joey im going to have to leave for a while go down to wilmington delaware with uncle frank there are good jobs down there honey in a little while a little while i ll be able to send for you and mom and jimmy and val and everything s going to be fine for the rest of our life my sister and my brothers for the rest of our life my dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it's about applause it's about your dignity it's about respect it's about your place in thecommunity it's about being able to look your child in the eye and say honey it's going to be okay and mean it and know it's true when barack and i were growing up there was an implicit understanding in america that if you took responsibility you d get a fair shot at abetter life and the values the values behind that bargain were the values that has shaped both us and many many of you and today those same values are barack s guiding star folks i ve watched him he has never wavered he never never backs down he always steps up and he alwaysasks in either one of thos critical meetings the same fundamental question how is this going to affect the average american how is this going to affect people s lives that s what s inside this man that s what makes him tick that s who he is applause folks because of the decisions he has made and the incredible strength of the american people america has turned the corner the worst job loss since the great depression we ve since created 4 5 million private sector jobs in the last 29 months as i mentioned at the outset four years ago we were hit hard you saw you saw your retirement accounts drained the equity in your homes vanished jobs lost along the line what did you do as americans what you ve always done you didn t lose faith you fought back you didn t give up you got up the american people you re the ones you re the reason why we are still better positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st century you never quit on america and you deserve a president who will never quit on you applause my fellow americans we now find ourselves at the hinge of history in the direction we turn is not figuratively it's literally inyour hands it has been a truly great honor to serve you and to serve with barack who has always stood up with you for the past four years i ve seen him tested i know his strength his commands his faith and i also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you i know this man yes the work of recovery is not yet complete but we are on our way the journey of hope is not yet finished but we are on our way and the cause of change is not fully accomplished but we are on our way so i say to you tonight with absolute confidence america s best days are ahead and yes we are on our way and in light of that horizon for the values that define us for the ideals that inspire us there is only one choice that choice is to move forward boldly forward and finish the job and re elect president barack obama god bless you all and may godprotect our troops god bless

a sunday show you say you have so many questions about and after a personal more than an hour long closed door meeting just for you who you run nothing but just for you just to answer your personal questions one on one face to face with those two officials all you can say i have so many questions suspe isn t it starting to seem no matter what answers they are given no matter what access they are given they are going to keep saying they have more questions here s one possibility about what maybe is really going on here fwhak 2004 a guy named mitt romney was the governor of the state of massachusetts if you don t remember who that is he was a private equity guy from massachusetts back in 2004 he was in the middle of his one and only term as governor the nominee for president was a senator from the same state john kerry of massachusetts if he had won the presidential election that year his senate seat would have become open so the governor of massachusetts the republican mitt romney would have been able to appoint somebody to fill john kerry s senate seat the mts legislature totally dominated by democrats was cognizant that the governor would probably pick a republican to fill the seat if kerry got elected president so the massachusetts state legislature decide d to change the law they changed the law so that only a special election could fill a vacant seat until then the seat would have to be empty mitt romney tried to veto that new law but the legislature overrode his veto thereby stripping mitt romney of his power to choose a replacement that became a mute point because john kerry didn t win so he stayed on as senator but then fast forward fife years 2009 new president barack obama the country embroiled in a big debate over national health reform those against it were against it to the point of rage and those wo who wanted it were excited to be on the cusp of achieving something they had failed to achieve for decades at the time the democrat hs a majority in the united states senate 60 seats is a filibuster super majority that s enough to pass health reform that majority for the democrats included senator ted kennedy senator kennedy spent his career trying to pass health reform it was his life s work he had done it at the state level with that guy mitt romney he had led on the issue nationally for decades it was his signature issue but before he was able to see health reform finally signed into law senator ted kennedy lost his life to brain cancer he died in august of 2009 when ted kennedy died that meant that his seat did become empty in massachusetts and the democrats no longer had their 60 vote super majority chrks they needed to pass health care they were short one vote knowing this might happen and this is really dramatic knowing that this might happen that might turn out this way before he died senator ted kennedy took a dramatic step to plan for the future of the health reform law he had worked for his whole life this health reform law that his death might make impossible to pass thinking about the affect that his death might have on the prospect of passing health reform senator kennedy wrote a letter before he died urging that the governor of massachusetts be allowed to fill an empty senate seat if one were to open up and with mitt romney gone the massachusetts senate legislature agreed so they changed the rules again so the new democratic governor this man could fill ted kennedy s seat with an interim office holder until a international election could be held thereby restoring with this interim office holder the democrat s 60 vote margin so at the last minute with that assist from the recently departed champion of health reform the democrats filled his seat with an interim senator and they squeaked the health reform bill through with zero republican votes and president obama signed it into law and now everybody calls it obama care even the democrats call it obama care and they mean that in a good way but then in the meantime there was the small matter of the special election to elect somebody to take over the full remaining portion of senator kennedy s term it was a strange election to permanently fill ted kennedy s seat there was one race on the ballot the turnout was very low it took place amid a right wing backlash to the democrats passing health reform tea party money and republican money from all over the country poured into the state of massachusetts and this unknown guy who happened to be a republican won that special election in january 2010 the next time massachusetts got a chance to reconsider that vote for scott brown was two and a half years later and in that election massachusetts frankly ree investigatored to form and picked the democrat they picked elizabeth warren to oust scott brown from that senate seat he held for less than a term the elizabeth warren scott brown race was pretty close by massachusetts standards the margin in the senate race this election had the democrat winning by eight points which sounds like a lot in a normal state that would be a lot but in the presidential race the democrat won the presidential race by a heck of a lot more than 8 points the democrat won by 23 points and that is a fairly normal margin by which democrats beat republicans in the state of massachusetts so given that scott brown losing by only eight can be considered kind of a victory it's at least pretty close and after that loss that scott brown loss and than credibly expensive and hard fought race immediately thereafter republicans wanted to talk about how to get scott brown back to washington and now today to them it seems so close they can taste it because although john kerry is still a senator from massachusetts after his very high profile role in the obama campaign and speaking gig at the democratic national convention after that john kerry s name was put forward as one possibility a leading possibility to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state that of course would result in him leaving his senate seat after all which would mean there would be a temporary ae re placement appointed and then there would have to be another special election to fill the rest of his term where scott brown would be the republican nominee again which would be the best chance of putting a republican in the senate any time soon which is why republicans got so excited when john kerry s name was floated his name was floated along with one other name for that job republican senators were very very quick to point out that they really prefer john kerry to be the nominee for secretary of state a ringing endorsement for john kerry from republicans in washington because if john kerry becomes secretary of state there s going to be a special election for a senate seat and there would be this chance that scott brown could be back in washington so the republicans say emphatically and repeatedly and to any reporter that will listen we prefer john kerry over susan rice for this job please if john kerry doesn t get secretary of state and he s maybe going to get secretary of defense instead i say woe be unto any feasible rival for that gig somebody who might get that cabinet position ahead of him too which republicans would please like to happen and you know what maybe this is nuts maybe this is nuts maybe this is why to simplistic but maybe this makes more sense than the contention we're supposed to believe which is that two active investigations multiple briefings a statement from the president a statement from the u n ambassador a closed door one on one meeting with that ambassador and with the director of the cia have not given john mccain enough opportunity to ask whatever questions he wants to ask about remarks made on a sunday morning talk show two and a half months ago maybe this makes more sense than that joining us is somebody more level headed andrea mitchell host of andrea

2004 campaign that john kerry versus george w bush campaign in the spring of that your photos surfaced that showed something going horribly wrong in one of the bush wars photos from an american run prison in iraq called abu graib they showed the prisoners being mistreated horribly and bizarrely sexual humiliation obvious physical abuse sexual assault prisoners being menaced by dogs obscene and medieval and americans who were doing it ultimately 11 soldiers were charged and convicted they were demoted but that was it donald rumsfeld stayed bush got re elected the war wentont for another seven years before we got a president who ended it as much as we may have just decided to move on from all that and consign it to the way we think of the bush era which is over there has been all these years one element of abu ghraib that could not really just be over and it was this these are army reservists we have blurred both faces but army reservists on the top of the screen army reservists prosecuted posing with a dead man the same man appears a few different times in the photo dossier from abu ghraib he got described as the iceman in the descriptions of the photos because his body was packed in ice in the picture but he had a name this is his widow and his son holding the same picture he was killed in U.S. custody military autopsy ruled his death a homicide the justice department announced this year they had reviewed about 100 cases of people abused or tortures by american personnel abroad and decided they would not prosecute anyone but they saved out two specific cases for full criminal investigation two cases where people in custody were killed one was a prisoner who died while shackled half naked to the wall of a freezing cold cell in afghanistan and one what mr mr aljamadi of everything that happened in the bush years they tried to push down the memory hole these were the two cases the murders that were held out as maybe worthy of prosecution 100 cases no prosecutions but these two okay maybe we ll look at those no last week on the last day of the republican national convention when mitt romney was busy not mentioning the war in afghanistan at all the justice department announced that day they would not prosecute anybody for those last two cases either the new york times editorialized any remaining hope for meaningful accountability and torture has ended for all practical purposes that s it the last two cases it's over as of thursday and then all of a sudden it wasn t over anymore yesterday a week after the justice department said that chapter in our history is over yesterday the book opened back up this is a drawing of a box a three foot by three foot box that a libyan man says he was locked inside by the cia in afghanistan three feet by three feet think about about that he and another man he and another man say that they were hung from a handcuffs inside this box that they ve drawn there would have been multiple people in this one in each stall that is barely wide muff for a man s body these drawings were published today by spencer ackerman at wired com the two circles you see in one of the stalls are speakers on either sides of the men whowould be suspended in boxes speakers blaring loud music directly into their ears a new report by human rights watch says that the man who describes having been locked inside the first cramped box was also waterboarded by americans in 2003 in afghanistan a whole new allegation of waterboarding we never knew about before the cia only admits to doing water boarding to three people and this new guy is not one of the ones they admit to the cia is denying his claims we ve never prosecuted any of this not even the murders we keep trying to put it behind us but it keeps coming back president obama on his first full day in office banned torture by U.S. personnel it is already illegal to torture are somebody and it was supposed to be banned but we did torture people during the bush administration so banning it after that administration meant rescinding all the ho couple pseudolegal advice that bush people used to supposedly justify it and protect people from prosecution the president made it no longer the policy of the united states to torture but his administration also decided to let the people who did torture get away with it and the man he is running against for president now says that he would happily reinstate the old bush era policies on torturing people on waterboarding prosecutions for torture would have made this a latter of law and justice and negativity policy not prosecuting it makes it just another policy issue just another choice between candidates just another choice that any president can make moving forward because there is a precedent of it being known in this country and unprosecuted in this country and therefore effectively legalized which means as long ago and as far as away as 2004 seems from this year and this election the american people have another choice to make in this election between torturing people or not that is still not a settled matter for us as a nation it's just a decision made by one man

questions one on one face to face with those two officials all you can say i have so many questions suspe isn t it starting to seem no matter what answers they are given no matter what access they are given they are going to keep saying they have more questions here s one possibility about what maybe is really going on here fwhak 2004 a guy named mitt romney was the governor of the state of massachusetts if you don t remember who that is he was a private equity guy from massachusetts back in 2004 he was in the middle of his one and only term as governor the nominee for president was a senator from the same state john kerry of massachusetts if he had won the presidential election that year his senate seat would have become open so the governor of massachusetts the republican mitt romney would have been able to appoint somebody to fill john kerry s senate seat the mts legislature totally dominated by democrats was cognizant that the governor would probably pick a republican to fill the seat if kerry got elected president so the massachusetts state legislature decide d to change the law they changed the law so that only a special election could fill a vacant seat until then the seat would have to be empty mitt romney tried to veto that new law but the legislature overrode his veto thereby stripping mitt romney of his power to choose a replacement that became a mute point because john kerry didn t win so he stayed on as senator but then fast forward fife years 2009 new president barack obama the country embroiled in a big debate over national health reform those against it were against it to the point of rage and those wo who wanted it were excited to be on the cusp of achieving something they had failed to achieve for decades at the time the democrat hs a majority in the united states senate 60 seats is a filibuster super majority that s enough to pass health reform that majority for the democrats included senator ted kennedy senator kennedy spent his career trying to pass health reform it was his life s work he had done it at the state level with that guy mitt romney he had led on the issue nationally for decades it was his signature issue but before he was able to see health reform finally signed into law senator ted kennedy lost his life to brain cancer he died in august of 2009 when ted kennedy died that meant that his seat did become empty in massachusetts and the democrats no longer had their 60 vote super majority chrks they needed to pass health care they were short one vote knowing this might happen and this is really dramatic knowing that this might happen that might turn out this way before he died senator ted kennedy took a dramatic step to plan for the future of the health reform law he had worked for his whole life this health reform law that his death might make impossible to pass thinking about the affect that his death might have on the prospect of passing health reform senator kennedy wrote a letter before he died urging that the governor of massachusetts be allowed to fill an empty senate seat if one were to open up and with mitt romney gone the massachusetts senate legislature agreed so they changed the rules again so the new democratic governor this man could fill ted kennedy s seat with an interim office holder until a international election could be held thereby restoring with this interim office holder the democrat s 60 vote margin so at the last minute with that assist from the recently departed champion of health reform the democrats filled his seat with an interim senator and they squeaked the health reform bill through with zero republican votes and president obama signed it into law and now everybody calls it obama care even the democrats call it obama care and they mean that in a good way but then in the meantime there was the small matter of the special election to elect somebody to take over the full remaining portion of senator kennedy s term it was a strange election to permanently fill ted kennedy s seat there was one race on the ballot the turnout was very low it took place amid a right wing backlash to the democrats passing health reform tea party money and republican money from all over the country poured into the state of massachusetts and this unknown guy who happened to be a republican won that special election in january 2010 the next time massachusetts got a chance to reconsider that vote for scott brown was two and a half years later and in that election massachusetts frankly ree investigatored to form and picked the democrat they picked elizabeth warren to oust scott brown from that senate seat he held for less than a term the elizabeth warren scott brown race was pretty close by massachusetts standards the margin in the senate race this election had the democrat winning by eight points which sounds like a lot in a normal state that would be a lot but in the presidential race the democrat won the presidential race by a heck of a lot more than 8 points the democrat won by 23 points and that is a fairly normal margin by which democrats beat republicans in the state of massachusetts so given that scott brown losing by only eight can be considered kind of a victory it's at least pretty close and after that loss that scott brown loss and than credibly expensive and hard fought race immediately thereafter republicans wanted to talk about how to get scott brown back to washington and now today to them it seems so close they can taste it because although john kerry is still a senator from massachusetts after his very high profile role in the obama campaign and speaking gig at the democratic national convention after that john kerry s name was put forward as one possibility a leading possibility to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state that of course would result in him leaving his senate seat after all which would mean there would be a temporary ae re placement appointed and then there would have to be another special election to fill the rest of his term where scott brown would be the republican nominee again which would be the best chance of putting a republican in the senate any time soon which is why republicans got so excited when john kerry s name was floated his name was floated along with one other name for that job republican senators were very very quick to point out that they really prefer john kerry to be the nominee for secretary of state a ringing endorsement for john kerry from republicans in washington because if john kerry becomes secretary of state there s going to be a special election for a senate seat and there would be this chance that scott brown could be back in washington so the republicans say emphatically and repeatedly and to any reporter that will listen we prefer john kerry over susan rice for this job please if john kerry doesn t get secretary of state and he s maybe going to get secretary of defense instead i say woe be unto any feasible rival for that gig somebody who might get that cabinet position ahead of him too which republicans would please like to happen and you know what maybe this is nuts maybe this is nuts maybe this is why to simplistic but maybe this makes more sense than the contention we're supposed to believe which is that two active investigations multiple briefings a statement from the president a statement from the u n ambassador a closed door one on one meeting with that ambassador and with the director of the cia have not given john mccain enough opportunity to ask whatever questions he wants to ask about remarks made on a sunday morning talk show two and a half months ago maybe this makes more sense than that joining us is somebody more level headed andrea mitchell host of andrea

and me was either date dinner or a movie because i couldn t stay awake for both and the truth is i loved the life we had built for our girls and i deeply loved the man i had built that life with and i didn t want that to change as he became president i loved barak just the way he was you see even back then when barak was a senator and a presidential candidate to me he was still the guy who picked me up for our dates in a car that was so rusted out i could actually see the pavement going by in a hole in the passenger s side door he was the guy whose proudest possession was a coffee table he had found in a dumpster and whose only pair of decent shoes was a half size too small but see when barak started telling me about his family see now that is when i knew i had found a kindred spirit somebody whose values and upbringing were so much like mine you see barak and i were both raised by families who didn t have much in the way of material possessions but who had given us something far more valuable their unconditional love their unflinching sacrifice and the chance to go places they had never imagined for themselves my father was a pump operator at the city water plant and he was decided with ms when my brother and i were young and even as a kid i knew there were plenty of days when he was in pain and i knew there were plenty of mornings when it was a struggle for him to simply get out of bed but every morning i watched my father wake up with a smile now grab his walker prop his walker slowly shave and button his uniform and when he returned home after a long day s work my brother and i would stand at the top of the stairs in our little apartment patiently waiting to greet him watching as he bent down to lift one leg and the oer to slowly climb his way into our arms but despite these challenges my dad hardly ever missed a day of work he and my mom were determined to give me and my brother the kind of education they could only dream of as i got to know barak i realized that even though he had grown up all the way across the country he had been brought up just like me barak was raised by a single mom who struggled to pay the bills and by grandparents who stepped in when she needed help barak s grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank and she moved quickly up the ranks but like so many women she hit a glass ceiling and for years men no more qualified than she was men she had actually trained were promoted up the ladder ahead of her earning more and more money while barak s family continued to scrape by but day after day she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus arriving at work before anyone else giving her best without complaint or regret and she would often tell barak so long as you kids do well bear that is all that really matters like so many american families our families were not asking for much they didn t begrudge anyone else s success okay that anyone else or they didn t care that anybody else had much more they simply believed in the fundamental american promise that even if you don t start out with much if you work hard and do what you re supposed to do you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids that is how they raised us those are the values that barak and i and so many of you are trying to pass on to our own children that is who we are and standing before you four years ago i knew that i didn t want any of that to change if barak became president well today after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways i never would have imagined i have seen firsthand that being president doesn t change who you are no it reveals who you are are you see i have gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like and i have seen how the issues that come across a president s desk are always the hard ones you know the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer the judgment calls where thestakes are so high and there is no margin for error and as president you will get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people but at the end of the day when it comes time to make that decision as president all you have to guide you are your values and vision and the life experiences that make you who you are so when it comes to re building our economy barak is thinking about folks like my dad and his grandmother he is thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day s work that is why he signed the lilly ledbetter pay act to help women get fair work that is why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet that is how he brought our economy from the edge of collapse to creating jobs again jobs you can raise a family on good jobs right here in the united states of america when it comes to the health of our families barak refused to listen to all of those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day another president he didn t care whether it was theasy thing to do politically no that is not how he was raised he cared that it was the right thing to do he did it because he believes that here in america our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine our kids should be able to see a doctor when they're sick and nobody in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or an illness and he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care that is what my husband stands for when it comes to giving our kids the education they deserve barak knows that like me and like so many of you he never could have attended college without financial aid and believe it or not when we were first married our combined monthly student loan bill was actually higher than our mortgage yeah we were so young so in love and so in debt and that is why barak has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121101_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know you would expect in a disaster this big that a president would be standing alongside and directing storm response with the governor from the state most affected by the disaster i mean generically speaking this sort of appearance is not a remarkable concept this thing becomes remarkable though to see president obama and chris christie standing together and praising one another and talking about the ways they are working together and seeing their coordinated state and federal disasters this sort of thing becomes remarkable today only because president obama is a democrat and chris christie is a republican and chris christie specifically is a republican who has been a very caustic partisan critic of president obama in his role as a campaign surrogate for mitt romney who president obama is running against in a presidential election that ends in six days mitt romney and that campaign today that campaign that chris christie has been supporting they made a somewhat remarkable decision to go ahead and keep campaigning today to get back on the campaign trail and start doing partisan campaign rallies again even while the president was still suspending his own schedule so he could respond to the storm so what we saw today in split screen was president obama departing the white house en route to storm ravaged new jersey after he stopped in at fema headquarters and at the same time mitt romney in full on campaign mode in tampa florida and then it was president obama touring coastal new jersey and comforting victims of hurricane sandy while mitt romney was holding what he called a big victory rally outside miami and while the romney campaign made sure to have their most telegenic staffers say on camera today that they were going to avoid any partisan commentary today out of respect for the storm victims they said they were going to avoid any partisan attacks on president obama on this very serious day they said they would do that but they apparently really did not mean it because at a rally in wisconsin today they had the republican party chairman talking about how america needs to fire barack obama and saying that the battle to defeat president obama is a battle for this country s freedom at a rally with mitt romney in florida today they had that state s former republican governor jeb bush talking about president obama as a failure his failure to bring this country together at the same event we had a republican state congressman tell parents that they should threaten to take halloween candy away from any children of obama supporters that they know tonight he suggested it i think the idea was he said that obama is a redistributionist and so you can scare kids and their obama supporting parents about redistribution if you steal the kids candy that was the tenor of the romney campaign today even as they told the press corps that they were going to be very respectful and nonpartisan and refrain from attacking the president today it was just a remarkable remarkable day a remarkable decision i mean president obama is expected to restart his campaign schedule tomorrow but mr romney did not want to wait for that he started his campaign events today im sorry are you stuck doing something else i ll take advantage of that i ll get back on the campaign trail im heading to florida apparently you re otherwise occupied well im not it's remarkable it is a remarkable decision to restart his campaign today but honestly it is also remarkable that mr romney never really stopped campaigning in the first place we reported yesterday on this event that mr romney held in dayton ohio yesterday afternoon it was the event that had previously been billed as a victory rally in dayton with the president off the campaign trail entirely to deal with the crisis the romney campaign realized it would be coarse to keep campaigning the campaign s communications director put out a statement on monday saying that the romney campaign was going to be canceling all campaign events out of sensitivity to the millions of americans in the path of hurricane sandy see they realized like they had to seem like they were being sensitive to the crisis but they really really wanted to hold that rally in dayton so what do you do how do you promise to cancel your political rallies in order to seem sensitive but then hold your rallies anyway well in the case of dayton yesterday and mitt romney they held the same event at the same time in the same venue with the same celebrity and they showed the same vote for mitt romney campaign video from the republican convention but they just changed the name of the event they called it a storm relief event instead of calling it a victory rally the one thing they changed materially about the campaign rally in order to make people call it a storm relief event is that they asked people to bring canned goods and groceries as donations to the red cross one of the problems with this as we talked about on last night s show is that that s not actually the right way to donate to the red cross i mean the desire to give groceries and canned goods at the time of a natural disaster comes from the right place it is a nice impulse but unless you re specifically requested by relief agencies or public officials to do that donating canned goods and groceries is just not logistically helpful s on a large scale and from across country especially if you are a presidential candidate getting national press implicitly telling the whole country this is the way to help this is what everybody ought to be doing im not just giving you my opinion on this this is explicitly what the red cross says about donations on their website they make clear under their frequently asked questions on their website that while they are grateful for any kind of thing people want to help they don t actually except donations like that the way you actually can help them is to donate blood or donate money of course having mitt romney do a photo op where people handed him money people handed him checks probably would not make as good a photo op as people handing him bags of cans so the romney campaign set up a photo op where people could hand him bags of cans buzz feed reporter mckay coffins was at that event and added some important detail today to how it all went down amazing story apparently the campaign was worried that people would not bring enough canned and stuff to donate and that would mess up their planned photo op of mitt romney carrying canned goods so quoting buzz feed the night before the event campaign aides went to a local walmart and spent 5 000 on granola bars canned foods and diapers as supporters lined up to greet the romney a young volunteer stood saying you need a donation to get in line one woman asked what if we dropped our donations off up front the volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate and said just grab something two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each and got in line when it was their turn they handed their quote donations to mr romney he took them smiled and offered an earnest thank you to be clear the romney campaign held their campaign rally kaup called it a storm relief event they bought donations for the red cross and then they handed those donations to their own supporters in order to photograph them handing them back to mitt romney so it would look like he inspired generous donations from those people that he actually did not inspire and if they had bothered to check with the red cross they actually don t want and they certainly don t want it modeled as national behavior as for what the red cross want again the red cross for the record does not want your cans they want your money and your blood donation if you do actually want to help i don t know what it looks like in a photo op but you can text the word red cross to 90999 that will give a 10 to the red cross that you will see appear on your phone bill you can do that right now as you are watching this show text 90999 the word red cross and that actually will help you can go to redcross org and donate through their website and you can donate blood at a blood drive in your local hometown this is a real disaster this is not a plot in a sitcom about how to run for president this is a real disaster an ongoing affecting millions of americans and real help really is needed and that is not the same thing as using the suffering of millions of americans as an occasion to accrue political capital for yourself by trying to create the appearance that you are helping when you are not bothering to actually try to really help that is something very different,1

2004 campaign that john kerry versus george w bush campaign in the spring of that your photos surfaced that showed something going horribly wrong in one of the bush wars photos from an american run prison in iraq called abu graib they showed the prisoners being mistreated horribly and bizarrely sexual humiliation obvious physical abuse sexual assault prisoners being menaced by dogs obscene and medieval and americans who were doing it ultimately 11 soldiers were charged and convicted they were demoted but that was it donald rumsfeld stayed bush got re elected the war wentont for another seven years before we got a president who ended it as much as we may have just decided to move on from all that and consign it to the way we think of the bush era which is over there has been all these years one element of abu ghraib that could not really just be over and it was this these are army reservists we have blurred both faces but army reservists on the top of the screen army reservists prosecuted posing with a dead man the same man appears a few different times in the photo dossier from abu ghraib he got described as the iceman in the descriptions of the photos because his body was packed in ice in the picture but he had a name this is his widow and his son holding the same picture he was killed in U.S. custody military autopsy ruled his death a homicide the justice department announced this year they had reviewed about 100 cases of people abused or tortures by american personnel abroad and decided they would not prosecute anyone but they saved out two specific cases for full criminal investigation two cases where people in custody were killed one was a prisoner who died while shackled half naked to the wall of a freezing cold cell in afghanistan and one what mr mr aljamadi of everything that happened in the bush years they tried to push down the memory hole these were the two cases the murders that were held out as maybe worthy of prosecution 100 cases no prosecutions but these two okay maybe we ll look at those no last week on the last day of the republican national convention when mitt romney was busy not mentioning the war in afghanistan at all the justice department announced that day they would not prosecute anybody for those last two cases either the new york times editorialized any remaining hope for meaningful accountability and torture has ended for all practical purposes that s it the last two cases it's over as of thursday and then all of a sudden it wasn t over anymore yesterday a week after the justice department said that chapter in our history is over yesterday the book opened back up this is a drawing of a box a three foot by three foot box that a libyan man says he was locked inside by the cia in afghanistan three feet by three feet think about about that he and another man he and another man say that they were hung from a handcuffs inside this box that they ve drawn there would have been multiple people in this one in each stall that is barely wide muff for a man s body these drawings were published today by spencer ackerman at wired com the two circles you see in one of the stalls are speakers on either sides of the men whowould be suspended in boxes speakers blaring loud music directly into their ears a new report by human rights watch says that the man who describes having been locked inside the first cramped box was also waterboarded by americans in 2003 in afghanistan a whole new allegation of waterboarding we never knew about before the cia only admits to doing water boarding to three people and this new guy is not one of the ones they admit to the cia is denying his claims we ve never prosecuted any of this not even the murders we keep trying to put it behind us but it keeps coming back president obama on his first full day in office banned torture by U.S. personnel it is already illegal to torture are somebody and it was supposed to be banned but we did torture people during the bush administration so banning it after that administration meant rescinding all the ho couple pseudolegal advice that bush people used to supposedly justify it and protect people from prosecution the president made it no longer the policy of the united states to torture but his administration also decided to let the people who did torture get away with it and the man he is running against for president now says that he would happily reinstate the old bush era policies on torturing people on waterboarding prosecutions for torture would have made this a latter of law and justice and negativity policy not prosecuting it makes it just another policy issue just another choice between candidates just another choice that any president can make moving forward because there is a precedent of it being known in this country and unprosecuted in this country and therefore effectively legalized which means as long ago and as far as away as 2004 seems from this year and this election the american people have another choice to make in this election between torturing people or not that is still not a settled matter for us as a nation it's just a decision made by one man depending on who s in that office the past is never dead it is not even past here s what happened i was talking to my best friend i told her i wasn t feelinglike myself i had pain in my pelvic area

invitation thank you for your extraordinarily warm welcome ann and i appreciate your friendship very very much thank you now al you are right a campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes we blue jeans in the morning perhaps suits for a lunch fund raiser sport coat for dinner but it's nice to finally relax and wear what ann and i wear around the house im glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition of course im pleased that the president s here we were chatting pleasantly this evening as if tuesday night never happened and i credit that of course to the cardinal it's taken new york s highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior i was actually hoping the president would bring joe biden along this evening because he ll laugh at anything of course this isn t a night for serious politics and it was especially nice to see president obama and cardinal dolan sharing the dais despite their differences im sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president s wine turns into water or for that matter whether my water turns into wine im pleased to once again have the chance to see governor cuomo who s already being talked about for higher office a very impressive fellow but he may be getting a little ahead of himself i mean let me get this straight the man has put in one term as a governor he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that s enough to run for president of course we're down to the final months of the president s term as presidents as president obama surveys the waldorf banquet room with everyone in white tie and finery you have to wonder what he s thinking so little time so much to redistribute and don t be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers he knows how to seize the moment this president and already has a compelling new campaign slogan you re better off now than you were four weeks ago you know with or without all the dignitaries that are here the al smith dinner surely lives up to its billing usually when i get invited to gatherings like this it's just to be the designated driver your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the catholic church i have special admiration for the apostle st peter to whom it is said upon this rock i will build my church the story is more inspiring when you consider he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say if you got a church you didn t build that of course only 19 days to go until the finish line campaign full of surprises the debates are very surprising just the other night we had a fun debate candy crowley was there and help to welcome us people seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates let me tell you what i do first refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate second find the biggest available strawman and then just mercilessly attack it big bird didn t even see it coming and by the way and in the spirit of sesame street the president s remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter o and the number 16 trillion campaigns can be a grueling exhausting president obama and i are each very lucky to have one person who s always in our corner someone who we can lean on and someone who s a comforting presence without whom we wouldn t be able to go another day i have my beautiful wife ann he has bill clinton we got a big dose of the biden charm last week i ll tell you that in his debate with paul ryan im not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that joe intended because afterwards i heard from the federal election commission from now on whenever he appears on tv there s a recording of me afterwards that says im mitt romney and i approve this message of course rules of fairness have to be enforced because what other safeguard do we have besides the press and applause now i never suggest that the press is biased i recognize they have their job to do and i have my job to do my job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country and their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it applause let s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things when suddenly i pulled ahead in some of the major polls what was the headline polls show obama leading from behind and i ve already seen early reports from tonight s dinner headline obama embraced by catholics romney dines with rich people applause of course the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church there have been some awkward moments like when the president pulled pope benedict aside to share some advice on how to deal with his critics he said look holy father whatever the problem is just blame it on pope john paul ii of course the president has found a way to take the sting out of the obama care mandates for the church for now on they're going to be in latin we have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me he and i of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest it would be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty but fortunately we don t carry the burden of disliking one another our president has had some very fine and gracious moments don t tell anyone i said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud you can oppose applause in our country you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will and that s how it is for me there s more to life than politics at the al smith foundation and the archdiocese of new york you show this in the work you do in causes that run deeper that allegiance to party or to any contest of the moment no matter which way the political winds are blowing what work goes on day in day out by this organization and you you answer with calm and willing hearts and service to the poor and care for the sick in defense in the rights of conscious and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born you strive to bring god s love into every life applause i don t presume to have all your support and a night like this im certainly not going to ask for it but you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that i stand proudly with you as an ally and friend god bless you all and god bless the united states of america thank you,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120913_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,a couple of cross currents here first of all it came right after laura ingraham rush limbaugh and others had criticized him for being too weak and not being aggressive enough so i think they were looking for an opportunity they certainly had to be defensive for having failed to mention afghanistan in their convention speech and they had been trying to defend themselves against that attack on foreign policy so perhaps that weighed into it but there s also something in the air here a minute does not pass where either campaign both campaigns aren t putting out a press release on something or another it's not just the social media it's you know old fashioned press releases and combative and it's bang bang push shove one side the other side both guilty of this and this is a serious businessand this is not tt stuff of combative political pressreleases and i can't recall rachel i don t think you can another time when the united states was under fire literally where a presidential candidate in either party put out a press release the normal response would be do nothing or say we have one president at a time there will be plenty of time later on to respond,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121006_010000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,i think the debate certainly does americans watched those debates that may not watch the next two that saw a mitt romney that was a direct contradiction to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of attack ads especially in swing states that the obama campaign has spent painting mitt romney as some kind of insensitive clueless bank accounts at the cayman islands kind of guy and he wiped all that away and also i think it was pretty clear that for the first time the president was put on the defensive as far as his record is concerned and that s because of this bubble he s been in for the last four years and he obviously couldn t defend it finally piers i thought one of the seminal moments in that debate was near the end when jim lehrer talked about the lack of bipartisanship the lack of sitting down together and averting this fiscal cliff that most americans know we're headed towards and mitt talked about being governor of massachusetts reaching across the aisle having to negotiate et cetera the president s responses sometimes you have to say no to people is that you know and the fact is first two years as mitt pointed out first two years of his presidency they just rammed things through without a single republican vote so i think those were that makes it probably one of the really more important debates in american history and perhaps im exaggerating because im so happy,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121101_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you know you would expect in a disaster this big that a president would be standing alongside and directing storm response with the governor from the state most affected by the disaster i mean generically speaking this sort of appearance is not a remarkable concept this thing becomes remarkable though to see president obama and chris christie standing together and praising one another and talking about the ways they are working together and seeing their coordinated state and federal disasters this sort of thing becomes remarkable today only because president obama is a democrat and chris christie is a republican and chris christie specifically is a republican who has been a very caustic partisan critic of president obama in his role as a campaign surrogate for mitt romney who president obama is running against in a presidential election that ends in six days mitt romney and that campaign today that campaign that chris christie has been supporting they made a somewhat remarkable decision to go ahead and keep campaigning today to get back on the campaign trail and start doing partisan campaign rallies again even while the president was still suspending his own schedule so he could respond to the storm so what we saw today in split screen was president obama departing the white house en route to storm ravaged new jersey after he stopped in at fema headquarters and at the same time mitt romney in full on campaign mode in tampa florida and then it was president obama touring coastal new jersey and comforting victims of hurricane sandy while mitt romney was holding what he called a big victory rally outside miami and while the romney campaign made sure to have their most telegenic staffers say on camera today that they were going to avoid any partisan commentary today out of respect for the storm victims they said they were going to avoid any partisan attacks on president obama on this very serious day they said they would do that but they apparently really did not mean it because at a rally in wisconsin today they had the republican party chairman talking about how america needs to fire barack obama and saying that the battle to defeat president obama is a battle for this country s freedom at a rally with mitt romney in florida today they had that state s former republican governor jeb bush talking about president obama as a failure his failure to bring this country together at the same event we had a republican state congressman tell parents that they should threaten to take halloween candy away from any children of obama supporters that they know tonight he suggested it i think the idea was he said that obama is a redistributionist and so you can scare kids and their obama supporting parents about redistribution if you steal the kids candy that was the tenor of the romney campaign today even as they told the press corps that they were going to be very respectful and nonpartisan and refrain from attacking the president today it was just a remarkable remarkable day a remarkable decision i mean president obama is expected to restart his campaign schedule tomorrow but mr romney did not want to wait for that he started his campaign events today im sorry are you stuck doing something else i ll take advantage of that i ll get back on the campaign trail im heading to florida apparently you re otherwise occupied well im not it's remarkable it is a remarkable decision to restart his campaign today but honestly it is also remarkable that mr romney never really stopped campaigning in the first place we reported yesterday on this event that mr romney held in dayton ohio yesterday afternoon it was the event that had previously been billed as a victory rally in dayton with the president off the campaign trail entirely to deal with the crisis the romney campaign realized it would be coarse to keep campaigning the campaign s communications director put out a statement on monday saying that the romney campaign was going to be canceling all campaign events out of sensitivity to the millions of americans in the path of hurricane sandy see they realized like they had to seem like they were being sensitive to the crisis but they really really wanted to hold that rally in dayton so what do you do how do you promise to cancel your political rallies in order to seem sensitive but then hold your rallies anyway well in the case of dayton yesterday and mitt romney they held the same event at the same time in the same venue with the same celebrity and they showed the same vote for mitt romney campaign video from the republican convention but they just changed the name of the event they called it a storm relief event instead of calling it a victory rally the one thing they changed materially about the campaign rally in order to make people call it a storm relief event is that they asked people to bring canned goods and groceries as donations to the red cross one of the problems with this as we talked about on last night s show is that that s not actually the right way to donate to the red cross i mean the desire to give groceries and canned goods at the time of a natural disaster comes from the right place it is a nice impulse but unless you re specifically requested by relief agencies or public officials to do that donating canned goods and groceries is just not logistically helpful s on a large scale and from across country especially if you are a presidential candidate getting national press implicitly telling the whole country this is the way to help this is what everybody ought to be doing im not just giving you my opinion on this this is explicitly what the red cross says about donations on their website they make clear under their frequently asked questions on their website that while they are grateful for any kind of thing people want to help they don t actually except donations like that the way you actually can help them is to donate blood or donate money of course having mitt romney do a photo op where people handed him money people handed him checks probably would not make as good a photo op as people handing him bags of cans so the romney campaign set up a photo op where people could hand him bags of cans buzz feed reporter mckay coffins was at that event and added some important detail today to how it all went down amazing story apparently the campaign was worried that people would not bring enough canned and stuff to donate and that would mess up their planned photo op of mitt romney carrying canned goods so quoting buzz feed the night before the event campaign aides went to a local walmart and spent 5 000 on granola bars canned foods and diapers as supporters lined up to greet the romney a young volunteer stood saying you need a donation to get in line one woman asked what if we dropped our donations off up front the volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate and said just grab something two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each and got in line when it was their turn they handed their quote donations to mr romney he took them smiled and offered an earnest thank you to be clear the romney campaign held their campaign rally kaup called it a storm relief event they bought donations for the red cross and then they handed those donations to their own supporters in order to photograph them handing them back to mitt romney so it would look like he inspired generous donations from those people that he actually did not inspire and if they had bothered to check with the red cross they actually don t want and they certainly don t want it modeled as national behavior as for what the red cross want again the red cross for the record does not want your cans they want your money and your blood donation if you do actually want to help i don t know what it looks like in a photo op but you can text the word red cross to 90999 that will give a 10 to the red cross that you will see appear on your phone bill you can do that right now as you are watching this show text 90999 the word red cross and that actually will help you can go to redcross org and donate through their website and you can donate blood at a blood drive in your local hometown this is a real disaster this is not a plot in a sitcom about how to run for president this is a real disaster an ongoing affecting millions of americans and real help really is needed and that is not the same thing as using the suffering of millions of americans as an occasion to accrue political capital for yourself by trying to create the appearance that you are helping when you are not bothering to actually try to really help that is something very different,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121103_010000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,spare change real change that was mitt romney s closing argument today in wisconsin and ohio a vote for me is a vote for real change and tonight just outside cincinnati the romney campaign attempting to underscore that message by holding a big mega rally in westchester ohio featuring nearly 100 governors senators keng men and other republican luminaries to talk about the real change you would get if you elect mitt romney so who did he enlist to sell this message of what real change he s offering america the headliners were george w bush s secretary of state george w bush s labor secretary the governor and current speaker of the house mitt romney change you can believe in if you really liked george w bush and if you like the current republican congress then we're the kind of real change we're looking for who cast this thing the democrats one of the reasons that the message of real change resonated back in 2008 because the country at large had ceased to be delighted by the george w bush administration and it wasn t just the war in iraq or or or or it was stuff like this this is the U.S. state department s annual report on global terrorism in 2003 every year they would put together a report like this detailing accidents of terrorism around the world and the next report after this one showed that despite the bush administration s claims that we were winning the war on terror despite the constant claims the number of terrorist attacks had gone up to its highest level in the two decades the state department had been publishing this report what was the bush administration s solution to that problem the solution was to stop publishing the report the bush administration just eliminated that annual report once it included something very politically inconvenient the bush administration had a habit of doing this if you don t like the data get rid of the data earlier they were face wd a new report from their own education department showing that charter school kids were falling behind public school kids how do you deal with your own administration s data on underperforming charter schools you cut back on the data that you collect about charter schools the bush administration just announced they would be collecting less data going forward in 2003 after the bush administration labor department report detailed mass layoffs in the manufacturing sector the bush administration announced they were going to stop publishing information about mass layoffs if we get rid of the data pointing to a problem maybe the data wouldn t look so bad the obvious move is to get rid of it this was a hall mark of the george w bush administration and it appears to be one of the things that mr romney liked very much about the george w bush administration it at least appears to be one of the things that he s promising to bring back you don t like the data presented kill the report after the totally unimpeachable ly did a report concluded that romney s plan would be great for rich people and hurt everybody else the response to that was to go guns blazing against the center you don t like the message shoot the messenger last month after the bureau of labor statistics announced the unemployment rate was going down the right started attacking the bureau of labor statistics as if they were the problem because they said the unemployment rate was going down it used to be that democrats and republicans would argue about how best to deal with some factual things some problem facing the national now republicans do it differently they do it differently than everybody else this is not a mirror image problems on both sides they refuse to acknowledge factual thing they are still doing it was brought to a whole new level last week when it was revealed that a nonpartisan tax report was withdrawn by a federal agency because republicans protested its findings the federal agency in question here is the congressional resource service they're kind of the gold standard congress s internal think tank members of congress have a question about policy or issue they look into it for them and they issue a report in response to a member of congress asking for that report the congressional research service is as nonpa parpartisan gets in washington and a little more than a month ago they issued a report on tax policy they found there is no connection between lowering the tax rates on millionaires and billionaires and creating economic growth there s no evidence that if you cut taxes on the rich that that makes the economy grow that s a problem because that is essentially mitt romney s whole reason for living this is the republican party s economic reason for existing if you cut taxes on the rich the job creators that will jump start the economy this is the whole basis of the party economic philosophy this is why congressional republicans pledge their first born children to a man named grover and here comes this highly respected agency that says it turns out the whole thing is bunk giving rich people a tax break doesn t help the economy but it sure does help rich people what do you do if you re the republican party you pressure the agency into burying the report which sp exactly what republicans in congress did this fall the new york times is reporting that the congressional research service quietly withdrew their entire report reportedly against the advice of their own economics experts this is amazing right if a report tells you something you do not want to hear get rid of the report especially if that report is coming out on the eve of a big election and it debunks your candidate s whole economic argument luckily breaking news the report does still exist you can find it right now you can read it right now it's not written very long you can find it at nanoblog com and dls nothing that republicans can do to stop that we will see you again on sunday night,1

hit,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120921_040000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,i think she did well she hit two very important points she made it clear that scott brown believes that under no circumstances do you raise taxes on the wealthiest and she says you need a balanced approach that means the only way you can reduce the deficit is by savaging all the programs domestic quality of line secondly she made that central point that he s not running just as scott brown he s generally a nice guy he wasn t as nice tonight as he usually is he s a nice guy i ve worked with him on some stuff but he s a cog in the right wing republican machine yes with the democrats in power he has the freedom to vote differently if he votes to put the republicans in power that changes she did an effective job on pointing that out,1

romney governor cuomo mayor bloomberg senator schumer all the distinguished guests who are here in less than three weeks voters in states like ohio virginia and florida will decide this incredibly important election which begs the question what are we doing here of course new yorkers also have a big choice to make you have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next four years tonight i am here with a man whose father was a popular governor and who knows what it's like to run a major northeastern state and who could very well be president someday and im hoping it is andrew cuomo this is the third time that governor romney and i have met recently as some of you may have noticed i had a lot more energy in our second debate i felt really well rested after the nice long nap i had in the first debate although it turns out millions of americans focused in on the second debate who didn t focus in on the first debate and i happened to be one of them i particularly want to apologize to chris matthews four years ago i gave him a thrill up his leg this time around i gave him a stroke of course there s a lot of things i learned from that experience for example i learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift so take note gentlemen now win or lose this is my last political campaign so im trying to drink it all in unfortunately mayor bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it that s okay im still making the most of my time in the city earlier today i went shopping at some stores in midtown i understand governor romney went shopping for some stores in midtown and it brought back some great memories because some of you know i went to school here in new york had a wonderful experience here used to love walking through central park loved to go to old yankees stadium the house that ruth built although he really did not build that i hope everybody s aware of that it's been four years since i was last at the al smith dinner i have to admit some things have changed since then i ve heard some people say barack you re not as young as you used to be where s that golden smile where s that pep in your step and i say settle down joe im trying to run a cabinet meeting here he does smile when he says it though tomorrow it's back to campaigning i visit cities and towns across our great country and i hear the same thing everywhere i go honestly we were hoping to see michelle and i have to admit it can be a grind sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever but paul ryan assured me that we ve only been running for 2 hours and 50 something minutes of course the economy s on everybody s minds the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since i took office i don t have a joke here i just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since i took office and we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds just the other day honey boo boo endorsed me so that s a big relief ultimately though tonight s not about the disagreements governor romney and i may have it's what we have in common beginning with our unusual names actually mitt is his middle name i wish i could use my middle name and even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight we're both thinking ahead of our final debate on monday im hoping that governor romney and i will have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of americans watching at home is this happening again when are they putting on the voice monday s debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy spoiler alert we got bin laden applause of course world affairs are a challenge for every candidate after some of you guys remember after my foreign trip in 2008 i was attacked as a celebrity because i was so popular with our allies overseas and i have to say im impressed with how well governor romney has avoided that problem just so everyone knows in our third debate we won t spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other we will also interrupt the moderator just to mix things up and finally let me say that i ve been doing some thinking and i ve decided that for our final debate im going to go back to the strategy i used to prepare for the first debate im just kidding im trying to make axelrod sweat a little bit get him a little nervous in all seriousness i couldn t be more honored to be here this evening im honored to be with leaders of both the private and public sectors and particularly the extraordinary work that is done by the catholic church it's written in scripture applause it's written in scripture that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope this country s fought through some very tough years together and while we still have a lot of work ahead we ve come as far as we have mainly because the perseverance and character of ordinary americans and it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season opposing candidates can share the same stage people from both parties can come together applause come together to support a worthy cause and i particularly want to thank governor romney for joining me because i admire him very much as a family man and a loving father and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones so applause we may have different political perspectives but i think in fact im certain that we share the hope that the next four years will have the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening may we all in the words of al smith do our full duty as citizens god bless you god bless your families and may god bless the united states of america thank you very much,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121009_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,that s been consistent and it's been mitt romney s hope if this is an election about the state of the economy and whether the president is partially or enough to blame for the bad economy he s going to lose that s why you see the president has been launching an attack against bain and other things that he was doing so that s been the weakness and the numbers too that im looking for on the inside the polls are mitt romney s attributes and his ratings among independents because forget whether the polls are skewed for ds or rs as long as mitt romney keeps winning independents chances are mitt romney s going to win in this pew poll he won independents today having nothing to do with whether it's skewed one party or the other that s something to keep your eye on romney s favorability is moving up obama s are moving down mitt romney s winning independents,1
attack,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20120915_090000_Piers_Morgan_Tonight,sure frankly it's just a misguided notion i think a majority of the american voters will see it that way i guess they have to do something because they're so behind on the issue of foreign policy that i guess they feel they have to throw everything plus the kitchen sink to see if they can make a dent in president obama s leadership here and frankly it shows in the numbers he s ahead by what 8 to 10 points on foreign policy and i think frankly the blunder that mitt romney made earlier this week in attacking president obama on 9 11 with misguided facts i think underscores the fact that he is just not ready to be commander in chief and they're worried about that,1
beat,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20121128_020000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,you just met for more than an hour with the director of central intelligence and with the american about whose comments on a sunday show you say you have so many questions about and after a personal more than an hour long closed door meeting just for you who you run nothing but just for you just to answer your personal questions one on one face to face with those two officials all you can say i have so many questions suspe isn t it starting to seem no matter what answers they are given no matter what access they are given they are going to keep saying they have more questions here s one possibility about what maybe is really going on here fwhak 2004 a guy named mitt romney was the governor of the state of massachusetts if you don t remember who that is he was a private equity guy from massachusetts back in 2004 he was in the middle of his one and only term as governor the nominee for president was a senator from the same state john kerry of massachusetts if he had won the presidential election that year his senate seat would have become open so the governor of massachusetts the republican mitt romney would have been able to appoint somebody to fill john kerry s senate seat the mts legislature totally dominated by democrats was cognizant that the governor would probably pick a republican to fill the seat if kerry got elected president so the massachusetts state legislature decide d to change the law they changed the law so that only a special election could fill a vacant seat until then the seat would have to be empty mitt romney tried to veto that new law but the legislature overrode his veto thereby stripping mitt romney of his power to choose a replacement that became a mute point because john kerry didn t win so he stayed on as senator but then fast forward fife years 2009 new president barack obama the country embroiled in a big debate over national health reform those against it were against it to the point of rage and those wo who wanted it were excited to be on the cusp of achieving something they had failed to achieve for decades at the time the democrat hs a majority in the united states senate 60 seats is a filibuster super majority that s enough to pass health reform that majority for the democrats included senator ted kennedy senator kennedy spent his career trying to pass health reform it was his life s work he had done it at the state level with that guy mitt romney he had led on the issue nationally for decades it was his signature issue but before he was able to see health reform finally signed into law senator ted kennedy lost his life to brain cancer he died in august of 2009 when ted kennedy died that meant that his seat did become empty in massachusetts and the democrats no longer had their 60 vote super majority chrks they needed to pass health care they were short one vote knowing this might happen and this is really dramatic knowing that this might happen that might turn out this way before he died senator ted kennedy took a dramatic step to plan for the future of the health reform law he had worked for his whole life this health reform law that his death might make impossible to pass thinking about the affect that his death might have on the prospect of passing health reform senator kennedy wrote a letter before he died urging that the governor of massachusetts be allowed to fill an empty senate seat if one were to open up and with mitt romney gone the massachusetts senate legislature agreed so they changed the rules again so the new democratic governor this man could fill ted kennedy s seat with an interim office holder until a international election could be held thereby restoring with this interim office holder the democrat s 60 vote margin so at the last minute with that assist from the recently departed champion of health reform the democrats filled his seat with an interim senator and they squeaked the health reform bill through with zero republican votes and president obama signed it into law and now everybody calls it obama care even the democrats call it obama care and they mean that in a good way but then in the meantime there was the small matter of the special election to elect somebody to take over the full remaining portion of senator kennedy s term it was a strange election to permanently fill ted kennedy s seat there was one race on the ballot the turnout was very low it took place amid a right wing backlash to the democrats passing health reform tea party money and republican money from all over the country poured into the state of massachusetts and this unknown guy who happened to be a republican won that special election in january 2010 the next time massachusetts got a chance to reconsider that vote for scott brown was two and a half years later and in that election massachusetts frankly ree investigatored to form and picked the democrat they picked elizabeth warren to oust scott brown from that senate seat he held for less than a term the elizabeth warren scott brown race was pretty close by massachusetts standards the margin in the senate race this election had the democrat winning by eight points which sounds like a lot in a normal state that would be a lot but in the presidential race the democrat won the presidential race by a heck of a lot more than 8 points the democrat won by 23 points and that is a fairly normal margin by which democrats beat republicans in the state of massachusetts so given that scott brown losing by only eight can be considered kind of a victory it's at least pretty close and after that loss that scott brown loss and than credibly expensive and hard fought race immediately thereafter republicans wanted to talk about how to get scott brown back to washington and now today to them it seems so close they can taste it because although john kerry is still a senator from massachusetts after his very high profile role in the obama campaign and speaking gig at the democratic national convention after that john kerry s name was put forward as one possibility a leading possibility to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state that of course would result in him leaving his senate seat after all which would mean there would be a temporary ae re placement appointed and then there would have to be another special election to fill the rest of his term where scott brown would be the republican nominee again which would be the best chance of putting a republican in the senate any time soon which is why republicans got so excited when john kerry s name was floated his name was floated along with one other name for that job republican senators were very very quick to point out that they really prefer john kerry to be the nominee for secretary of state a ringing endorsement for john kerry from republicans in washington because if john kerry becomes secretary of state there s going to be a special election for a senate seat and there would be this chance that scott brown could be back in washington so the republicans say emphatically and repeatedly and to any reporter that will listen we prefer john kerry over susan rice for this job please if john kerry doesn t get secretary of state and he s maybe going to get secretary of defense instead i say woe be unto any feasible rival for that gig somebody who might get that cabinet position ahead of him too which republicans would please like to happen and you know what maybe this is nuts maybe this is nuts maybe this is why to simplistic but maybe this makes more sense than the contention we're supposed to believe which is that two active investigations multiple briefings a statement from the president a statement from the u n ambassador a closed door one on one meeting with that ambassador and with the director of the cia have not given john mccain enough opportunity to ask whatever questions he wants to ask about remarks made on a sunday morning talk show two and a half months ago maybe this makes more sense than that joining us is somebody more level headed andrea mitchell host of andrea

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121017_000000_The_OReilly_Factor,he has got to be careful not to look like he has a testy attitude because this is in front of voters he has been training real hard on mannerism so he can connect with voters and he show he can be successful and empathize with voters when they ask him questions both cases whether it's the president or mr romney they are going to take questions from the audience answer the voters questions and say i hope that answers your question and turn it right around and turn it into an attack on one another the president knows he had has to be prepared for romney s aggressiveness the obama campaign hasn t beenthe least bit coy about this they have been boasting about how the president is going to be the onus is on the president he has got to turned the tide the vice presidential debate didn t hurt romney in the polls it didn t change romney s momentum growth the president has to try to stem that tonight,1

hit,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121127_040000_The_OReilly_Factor,bill im bill o reilly thanks for watching us tonight a tale of two americans california and texas that is the subject of this evening s talking points memo over the thanksgiving weekend i was down in austin in houston texas doing shows with miller it's been a while since i had visited the lone star state and i took a good look around next week i will be going tout to california the state with the largest population texas is second fascinating to compare the two places because they signify the clash the clash that s taking place in america right now texas voted for romney by about 1 3 million votes california voted for obama by about 2 3 million votes texas conservative state california dominated by liberal americans both states have more minority voters than white voters the overriding tradition of texas is that self reliance rules most voters there don t want government telling them what to do therefore they don t have a lot of social service no state income tax in texas however get in the lone star state about 40 billion there is a balanced budget amendment by contrast california owes an astounding 167 billion and it's running an annual deficit of about 9 billion money they that can never never be paid back what is california getting for all of that high school graduation rate 37 out of 50 states per capita income 44 500 but there is a 10 1 unemployment rate crime number one there are more prisoners in california than any other state take a look at texas high school graduation rate ranks 44th slightly above california per capita income about 40 000 bucks per year but there is relatively low unemployment 6 6 convicts in state prisoners ranked number two behind california so you can see there is not a big difference in the economic and social stats but there is a big difference in mind set california has many more social welfare programs golden state also has many more business regulations texas you could pretty much set up any bigness you want you can also ride a motorcycle without a helmet talk on the cell phone without a car and on and on texans basically saying hey government get out of our lives californians on the other hand generally embrace big government in just about all areas i mean when the city council of san francisco proposes to ban gold fish you know you have intrusive situation same city council finally banned publicity nudity last week except for permitted festivals or parades thank god the thanksgiving day parade not held in the city by the bay in texas if you run around naked and make a wrong move you might get shot the state allows its citizens to carry concealed weapons can't do that if you are naked in california only vicious drug cartel people carry guns because if the regular folks do likely be big trouble get in big trouble when the cartel guys go back to mexico can you see there is a stark difference between living in texas and living in california the question for all americans is what place do you think is better i like both states they are fascinating i don t want to live in a nanny state that s what california is new york is getting there as well where i live california is also going bankrupt 167 billion in debt are you kidding me that is grossly irresponsible for a state with as many natural resources as california i mean these pinheads in sacramento think they can just spend money and other people have to pick up the tab meantime in texas if you hit it big you get to keep much of what you earn yes there are local taxes but the state does not impose an income tax that s why so many workers are moving to the lone star state florida is a situation there comes a point where etch auto of us has to decide what kind of country we want many americans are depressed because traditional america seems to be disappearing certainly president obama is a big government progressive guy and now he has a second term talking points doesn t expect the president to change his philosophy is he going to spend enormous amount of money on social justice and he is going to take money from successful americans in in order to finance his vision could be wrong but i don t believe that s going to help the economy very much however the president is going to do the social justice thing no matter what in texas the government does not believe that redistributing income is its responsibility all does not believe that you should micromanage the lives of its citizens if you are dumb enough to ride a motorcycle without a mel helmet and you wind up in a cemetery it's your call trust me nobody is banning 16 ounce soft drinks in waco again it goes back to everybody has a gun in california and the federal government if koop after if california and the federal government keep spending the way it's been spending both will go bankrupt before they leave office very true tax scheme bubbling under the surface so called wealth tax in france spain iceland switzerland they taxed net word of wealthy people every year doesn t matter if you earn anything or you get income or dividends doesn t matter if you have assets house gold car whatever those governments are going to take some of that uber liberals in america want to do the same thing,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20121019_040000_Hannity,my understanding it was a rather long lasting event the attack so it stands to reason they would call in for help going back to the susan rice testimony another thing that s curious about it's to kind of understate the word is why would she go out there and say things that apparently the state department itself didn t believe we had a state department official recently saying it wasn t our conclusion that it was a spontaneous protest that ran out of control you had a state department official saying they were monitoring it in real time how does susan rice get it in her head to say these other things dana if you re a high official in a re election campaign something like this happened somebody is going on every single sunday show wouldn t you community with that communicate with that person talk to her before,1

attack,http://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20120913_080000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show,come on mitt think mr romney s sort of half cocked remarks about russia being our number one geopolitical foe have been criticized by great effect by democrats but have caused him a lot of trouble within his own party as well it happened on this issue of russia it also happened on the issue of china you may remember mr romney running up against the issue of the blind dissident in china who was ordered to remain under house arrest by the chinese government and who sought help from U.S. officials in china while U.S. officials were engaged in intense and very delicate negotiations over chen s fate mitt romney took to the campaign trail in order to attack the obama administration s handling of the situation he based his attack solely on minute by minute reports that were coming out of china at the time the crisis was stillongoing,1
beat,http://archive.org/details/CNNW_20121009_000000_Anderson_Cooper_360,i think it's moved from a race that was heavily tilted toward obama the president was just beating romney as a campaigner and the debate has now made it much more of a horse race and we're likely to see fluidity right to the end and the win may go because we see these numbers move three four points on a debate it may be a couple points on the unemployment numbers the win may go to the guy who has the last big play who has the last big favorable play i don t think these debates are fool s gold i know cornell wouldn have said that if obama had won i think they were really important turning point but it's turned it into a much much closer race,1
